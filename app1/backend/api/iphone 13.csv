If you aren't having any problems with your 13PM then I don't think its worth it to switch because there's really nothing that groundbreakingly different.,"Newer larger battery, larger always on screen, more camera choices. You could do worse.","Switched from a base 13 to a 15 Pro and I love it. I wouldn’t say the phone is *very* different but the changes are very welcome and  it’s fun to use it.

It’s not like going from, say an 8 to an X, but it’s still an upgrade. If you can afford it and want a new phone I’d go for it.","The 13 is a great phone, I would wait for the 16 pro","As a big apple fan i would say yes. But if you think logic is not a good economical decision, as your phone still do all you want.",I don’t think so…,"Here’s my thought process. Idk if I can actually answer your question for you.

 It would cost you 80 USD to have the battery swapped out in the 13. If the 13 is still good otherwise, you could keep using it another year or two.

That being said, look around eBay or Facebook marketplace etc and see how much your phone would fetch if you sold it. Apple trade in won’t give you as much as you would get otherwise. But being that it’s not a 13 pro, it may be worth looking into selling, and if you get a good price then why not upgrade. Providing you can afford the upgrade and don’t finance it. My rule is that unless it’s something like a car or a house and you can’t afford buying it without financing, then you don’t NEED it.","Yes, especially if you take lots of pictures.",I would say so but i just upgraded from 12 pm to 15pm and the only difference is Dynamic Island. Honestly moving forward any Apple phone update is not going to be ground breaking. They’ll just copy what Android is doing. This might be my last one for a while. If battery goes to shit I’ll just replace the battery,"I would / I went from 14 plus to 15 pro and I’m so glad I did - the feeling in your hand is amazing (the rounded screen edges makes it one of the best feeling phones I’ve ever held) , the screen on the pro version is so much better than the 14 plus (base model) I had - and the camera is insane on the 15 pros - the screen is incredible compared to base models (literally no sun glare and I don’t have any issue whatsoever during the day in bright sun seeing the screen like my 14 +)

I thought I’d like the bigger 15 pro max , but they were back ordered so I got a 15 pro and I’m so happy I did 

Best phone I’ve had so far , personally",Yes,"I gave my wife my 13PM (still has 95% battery health) and I picked up a 15PM for myself. It’s nice, but the only things I like more are the camera, USB-C and the weight of the phone. If you are coming from a regular 13, then the screen will be a nice upgrade, too. Oh, and 256GB minimum size for storage would be another reason to upgrade (plus, you can always easily plug in more storage via the USB port without needing a dongle). 

If you have a regular 6.1” 13, then the 15PM is a worthy upgrade, especially if you like to take video and pictures.","You can, if you feel like it.

Get the cheaper one.,"The 14 is a 13 Pro CPU in a 13 body with crash detection and satellite sos.

Best tech..  but the minor changes going forward might make me be patient again.  This phone is more than I could expect from a phone in every aspect.  And I’m a pro photographer.  Excellent cameras for how small the chips/lenses are.  I didn’t think they’d get this good a decade ago. But here they are.  And 12mp is about the sweet spot but tech keeps getting better so I guess if the noise ain’t too bad the denser chips will work fine.  Just kinda silly to be walking around with 40-50-100mp camera in your pocket.  But I guess that fixes some of the zoom limitations right?  Just crop.  But I’d take 10mp all day over 100mp, chips being same size… was hoping apple would stick to knowing what’s best for 99% of people.. guess the mp# might matter for marketing to stupid humans. O well, again they’re great now anyways.  But could be phenomenal if they continued to make 12mp chips but with better lenses and noise handling…",Yeah I’ve been debating this transition myself.

I've bought a 13 mini and I am blown by how much I've actually missed small, capable phones. I have an Android as my daily driver and the 13 mini as a backup phone, but I find myself gravitating towards using the 13 mini more and more with each passing day. It's a great device, barely feeling it in my hand/pocket, the MagSafe feature is so cool, the phone never lagged, it actually beat one of my gaming phones (a Redmagic 6s Pro) in some graphics benchmarking tests. I highly recommend the 13 mini and would have instantly preordered a 15 mini, if Apple would have released it.
 On another note: doesn't Apple see how many iPhone 13 mini users there are? I'm pretty sure they can check that, not just based on how many have been activated, but how many are currently active/in actual use.","I have a mini and recently purchased s23 Ultra instead of the iPhone 15 so I still am in the Apple ecosystem through my mini but I have a smartphone that has a good battery life.

Main reason was that the 13PM has nano-sim capability whereas the 14PM is eSIM only.  I travel internationally a lot and multi-device autonomy is very important to me and was the deciding factor.  Differences in other functionality is minimal besides the dynamic island.  Did I overpay? Probably but at least Apple certified phones have the new phone warranty and I got what I wanted.,"Yep, unless you really want the dynamic island or upgraded camera the 13 pro max is still great.

Lahat ng pwede mong gawin, will heat the battery ever so slightly.","Pinakamabisang paraan is huwag mo icheck batt health mo. Nasa psychological lang yan. Gamitin mo sa kung saang paraan mo gustong gamitin. Pag masyadong kang conscious sa batt health mo, di mo fully ma eenjoy ang phone mo. For example, may nabasa ka na dapat 50% nakacharge kana, it means na if may ginagawa ka pero almost 50%na batt health mo, then hahanap kana ng outlet/pb para makapagcharge and in that case hindi mo talaga ineenjoy fully yung phone mo.",Charge at 30-40% then charge to 80%,"Batteries are consumable po, replacement at service centers will cost only around 5k. My iphone 12 used around 2 years (heavy usage) has been 80%. I'd suggest use it fully.","Dont charge to 100%, don't go below 20%","Pinaka basic is never go less than 20% and more than 80%
You can check MKBHD’s YT video about battery health po","Simple solution: To maintain the battery at a 100% health, keep it in the box and don’t use it!
Batteries degrade naturally and it doesn’t make sense to expect that you can maintain it at 100% especially if you use it as it is intended to be used.","I currently use an IP 13 too, in just a span of 7 months my batt health was 90%. Its been a year and still in 90%. Just use it like how its suppose to and relax","Been at 100% with the IP 14 Pro Max for 6 months now. My advice is to never let the % reach below 20, charge till 80%, take out the phone case while charging and not use it while charging 😊 hope this helps","Yung friend ko na buy and sell ng iphone ganito turo sakin. Imagine months sa kanya phone pero 100% pa rin.

1. Charge whenever you can. Kahit anong percent basta may charger go. 

2. Never ever gagamitin phone ng naka charge

3. Wag paaabutin ng 20%. 30 pa lang charge mo na.

4. Once mag 100 tanggalin mo na sa charger. Or ako parang months na never ko na 100% pero keri lang. 

5. Wag na wag mag oover charge.

Yun lang.","Just use it whenever and however you want. I did these “tips” sa iphone 13 ko. Never nag below 20%, scheduled na 7 pm mag charge up to 90-92%, hindi ginagamit while charging, but still, the battery degraded how it was expected to degrade within a year. Don’t be TOO concerned about it, it’s natural for a battery to degrade. Ma ruruin lang yung experience mo kapag inisip mo yun nang inisip (like what happened to me).","Yung wala nang isip-isip na paraan:
Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging > turn on Optimized Battery Charging.

Your phone is smart enough to know your charging habits, and will adjust charging speeds and rates and all of that accordingly. It knows you don’t use your phone when asleep, so it stops at 80% until before you wake up.

Kung praning ka pa rin:
NEVER use wireless charging.

Heat is bad for batteries. Wireless chargers generate heat since they’re more inefficient than wired charging.

But really, just use your phone as you will. Sayang sa headspace kung ang dami mong iniisip.","If you really want to take this route, aside from the tips of the previous users na hanggang 80% lang charging at di bababa 20%

Also buy a cheap android phone to use at home. 

This way pag uuwi ka, di na laspag main iphone mo, if magsosocmed ka lang naman at messenger.","Batteries will still degrade overtime. Smartphones these days are so advanced that you could just leave it charging and it will trickle charge when it hits 100.

The best advice I could give you is to use the phone however you want and not be paranoid about its battery health at all. Regardless of how you use it, it will still degrade eventually","wag mo po gamitin sure 100%. kidding aside proper charging lang pero wag mo na masyado isipin yang battery health. Gamitin mo yung Phone para ma sulit mo yung binabayad mo. if sobrang low na ng bat health, battery replacement lang nmn yan.",20-80% and wag agad magupdate pag major update example nung ios17.

Keep it in the box and never use it 🤣","Hi OP, for what purpose did you buy your iphone? I don’t see any reasons why you were that worried of its battery life. mag de degrade at mag de degrade yan. I mean, for sure naman na hindi mo ipan didisplay lang yan or ipang call and text lang, right? I get it that it is your most expensive purchase to date (?) but it is bound to wear and tear. so just use it.","keep your batt not below 20% and not above 80% when charging. also, kapag may IOS updates, don’t auto update. update mo lang yung OS when it is NEEDED na and may mga noticeable glitches and bugs na when using","pag ka bili mo ng iphone, bili ka samsung tapos idisplay mo iphone mo na nkacharge.","80% after 2 years is normal. STOP WORRYING! Battery replacement only costs below 6k,2-3 hr waiting time. Gamitin mo ng gamitin hangat hinuhulugan mo, deserve mo yan.","Iphone, better integration, build quality and security, in my opinion. And this is coming from a dev who likes  the customizability of Android.",Reading this on my Iphone 7+. Im not complaining Im a decade behind,"S23 for Type-C. iPhone for Airdrop. Choose your fighter. Char

Kakaswitch ko lang from 14 Pro to S23U. And mas okay para sakin tbh. Wala kasi gamit sakin ang iMessage, FaceTime. Airdrop for travels lang. 

If manggagaling kang Android, you'll feel really restricted sa iPhone. Ang daming pindutin sa iPhone bago ka makarating sa paroroonan. Hahaha",Even an Iphone 11 is enough for the majority of the users.,"If we're going with the original question, the answer is YES. iPhone 13 would still be usable for at least 3 more years. I know a good amount of people that still use the iPhone X in 2023 and it still does the job for them. With that in mind, iPhone 13 is still far from being obsolete imo.

Regarding the S23 v iPhone 13:
Buying an iPhone is like buying a Rolls Royce; the car is expensive, reliable, and has good features. However, you won't dare alter what's under the hood. An android phone (S23) on the other hand, is like a Nissan Skyline GT-R in a sense that you can customize the heck out of it.

So if you like personalizing your phone and doing all kinds of stuff with it, get the android. Otherwise, get the iPhone.","go ka na for iPhone. I was in the same dilemma a month ago. Pero i went with the same device, iphone 13. Pag nag android ka ulit hahanap-hanapin mo ulit ang iOS. At least pag nanawa ka with ur iphone pwede mo ibenta then buy the s23.",Yes even nga iphone 11.. pwede pa ngayon. Hehe,"I love android's openness but when my bank apps refuse to open just because enabled ang dev options, i shifted to iphone. Closed os lang din pala e de mag iphone na.","Based from your use case, yep the base 13 would still be worth it. S23 is also a good choice because of its specs and the higher refresh rate screen. 

If you’re really interested in dipping your toe sa Apple echo system, 13 is a good entry point. Only go with s23 if you really want that higher refresh rate (personally I would always pick the one with a higher refresh rate since sanay na ako lol, that’s why I went with the pro lineup).","if you're more have a socmed or photos person go for the iPhone. If hindi mo hilig mga yan, go for the S23",2nd hand sa greenhills. Magdala ka na lang ng tropa na marunong tumingin,"The IP13 is worth it for the Factime/iMessage alone. I use my phone to communicate with my family and partner who are all using iOS. Messenger, Viber, and TG sucks compared to iMessage.","Yup worth it paaa

Iphone ka para mabilis na kayo magpasahan ng shota mo ng pics haha 

Based sa usage mo ip since gusto mo lng ata na gumagana / everyday na phone ( di ka masyado maphone ) 

May facetime pa kayo ( facetime lng malinaw na chat apps pag mayos internet try it yourself )","Yes worth it ang iPhone 13. Got an iPhone 13 a year ago. It is still smooth and in good shape. Feature wise, naka iPhone kasi family member ko, so madali na mag message and especially sharing photos and video with AirDrop. Goods din camera nya, kahit walang ProRaw or Raw format sa camera app, goods din. Great battery life, great screen, great experience. So far yan masasabi ko","Being someone who always prefers an android over iphones, I'd go with android. BUT, if you are into the quality of photo and videos, go with an iphone. Iba talaga quality kahit Iphone 13 pa yan.

We have tested several top of the line phones vs iphones iba talaga ung photo, mas maganda pag iphone.","If mostly ios gamit ng friends and family, yes worth it.","I’m running an iPhone 12 Pro. It still feels like it’s new and no complaints from me. I can imagine a 13 is going to do much better

Other than airdrop. One of the features that I use the most with family is shared library. Instead of having to basically share pictures so everyone has a copy, this lets pictures be automatically shared depending on the settings you’ve set, or even just set pictures to be immediate added into the library. Pretty nice",iPhone is worth it. I am actually still using iPhone 11 - I bought it at the time na lumabas yung iP12. 😅 Still worth it!!,YESSS my colleague bought an iphone 13 few months ago. She likes it naman! If u can pa gawin mo na pro max! Sulit na sulit naman for the battery,"Coming from iPhone 7 Plus, upgrading to iPhone 13 this year was worth it for me. As far as iOS updates go, my iPhone 7 Plus is still receiving iOS 15 updates with the latest one being 15.8. Bought that last December 2016 and it still works in 2023, problem is the battery is shit that it needs servicing, planning on changing it soon din since it is still decent naman but as far as the other apps go like mobile games, medyo demanding na sa phone so the 13 was the upgrade that was needed. Didn't go to 14 since same lang na chipset, didn't get the Pro and Pro Max versions since I didn't need the extra camera. Base model is just as fine. Kinda wish there was a 13 Plus kaso 13 Mini yung alternative, almost bought that instead kaso talo sa battery but to each their own naman pagdating sa iba't-ibang iPhone models.","I used to buy high end phones.. I tried cheaper a cheaper model.. and it works with my daily usage and is a lot cheaper. so for me, esp for an iPhone yes older models are fine",Still using my iphone 12 pro and still giving me the satisfaction,Bought my iPhone 13 last year and no regrets. It’s also my first iOS . I like how light and handy siya compared to my android device.,"Not everything is better just because the spec sheet told you so. The optimization on iPhone is far ahead than android that's why it only requires few rams (I both own S23 and 14PM).  
For longevity and smoothness, go with iphone. Even with flagship android, I still feel the never ending beta-like experience with android while IOS felt more complete.  


Its also a huge problem if you have a person who's an IOS user and it is truly useful to you once you have it. My wife owns 13PM and the smooth connectivity is on another level. The quality of Facetime is immaculate, video and photos we're lossless when passing it with IOS.","im using ip13pro for two years now. Did you know that ip13 according to livemint that iPhone 13, which was launched in 2021, secured the first position as the best-selling model, while the iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max followed at second and third positions, respectively. I short its pretty practical to buy one based on your budget without any compromises. I used facetime, airdrop, message feature and icloud for flexible storage. Mostly security 😊",Yes to iPhone 13! Halos same lang sila features ng 14. Kaya don’t bother to get that at a higher price.,"Yup definitely. It has great battery life too. With how iOS gets rolled out, I’d give it a good 3-4 years. Heck, my iPhone 8 didn’t make it to iOS17 but just last week I got a notif saying that it’s still eligible for iOS 16.7.2, meaning I’d still get enough support for it.",sam s23 is bettter.,"iphone 13 is fairly new and usually it takes 7-8years ang support nila sa isang iphone model (compare sa mga old models way back 2013)

anyways, worth it naman mag iOS. 120Hz and higher ram? that won't matter if you're not even a hardcore gamer. You wouldnt even feel much of a difference. Kapag naka experience kanlang ng 120hz tsaka mo palang manonotice na iba ang 60hz. and with the ram? you really dont need that much RAM sa phone. and it wont matter sa iphones kase every apps run smoothly even with games. Kahit mag switch apps ka from time to time, it'll ruj smoothly.

as a techy person, RAM variants sa phone talaga ung di ko magets sa phones like as if it's a PC. u can only do much sa phone and pagdating naman sa phone u wont run multiple programs all at once. Unlike sa PC na RAM really matters kase system processes and programs consumes a lot of memory to run.

tho, sa pagkakaalam ko super mag kalapit lang price ng iphone 13 at iphone 14 so why not aim na for iphone 14 if keri pa ng budget,",Worth it.,"If priority mo ang memories ng relationship, I strongly recommend ip13. Yup I am using ip13 and useful siya. Clearer photos and videos ang nasheshare niyo na memories with each other kasi napepreserve yung quality. Android is best for consuming and creating content tapos sa iphone mag upload mas mabilis at direct. I can say maganda ang iphone for relationships talaga when storing memories. Iphone 12 naman yung ex ko. Kung tatanungin mo bakit ex ko na siya, e ibang story naman yun hehe","Go for the ip13. Just got mine and I love it. I also love my old phone, samsung note 10 but samsung already ended its support. Shame, its still working perfectly and I have so much storage left. If you're really the type who doesnt change phone often, best to go for an iphone","imo mag s23 ka nalang pu, mas mahal yung Ip13 kesa sa s23 pero pambalagbagan ung performance sa camera according sa camera rating, pros pa pede mag sideload ng apps apk mod or such if you're not fortune sa buhay. mas matagal battery pero pambalagbag talaga pang clout yung IP13 interms sa fb and insta ang cute ng ui lalo na pag magshashare ka ng post sa stories.","S23 ka nalang, sulit.",S23 gurl. periodt.,"Given how iOS works? No. 13 is going to be good FOR NOW, but just wait until you start getting messages that you can't update your apps because the latest app doesn't support your current version of iOS and your phone doesn't support the latest version of iOS.",iPhone prices are not justifiable for me no matter how I look at it... Even now I'm just eyeing phones below the 20k mark for my needed upgrade. Currently am using my 5 year old Zenfone 5,"the s23 is at 34k at kimstore so ayun din. and if medyo doubting ka if legit, you can buy it from their website, pick it up in a mall (meron silang mga partner 3rd party mall stores) and inspect there before paying for it.","You can buy a second-hand iPhone 13 Pro even a Pro Max with your 40k which is miles better than the base 13. But if you want brand new, then not bad na rin ang 13.

I saw a trusted seller sell a second-hand iPhone 14 PM for 49,000.",iPhone 13 in my honest opinion is the best in the series so far. Battery health is way better than 14.,I still use 12 pro max oks pa battery life lang problema,Iphone 13 ang pinakasulit na iphone ngayon imo,I bought my iPhone 13 last year October and it is still great! Smooth as usual and camera quality is goooooood 😊,"No, not really. The only iphones that are worth it to me are pros and pro maxes since those have 120hz displays.","The great thing about iOS is not the specs. Sure, Android phones has better specs in paper but what matters most is how the phone functions. In iPhone, every app works seamlessly because of the great hardware-software communication. In Android, most apps are buggy because of Android OS in different brands has different features and codes that makes it difficult for App developers to integrate it perfectly with Android. Also, the ease of use by the Apple ecosystem is the best. I own an Android and an iPhone but the simplicity of Apple's devices and the longevity is the best. Not to mention, it's resell value. You'll still get a decent amount of money should you decide to sell your Apple device and upgrade.","I just want to add on the diff apps you are using. Idk lang if fan lang talaga ako sa iOS but diff talaga qual ng facetime vs messenger like 10x better talaga. Ive had experiences na tumawag si SO sakin sa messenger tas grabe pixelated, pagtransfer sa facetime, para talagang tumitingin ka lang ng video sa sobrang smooth (but still depende pa din sa connectivity, but I find ft to have better quality)

Sa imessage naman, sobrang swak yung may isesend yung kausap mo na photo, nasasave sa gallery mo + the info kung kanino galing. Idk might not be everyone’s cup of tea pero gusto ko to na feature. Also! Di masyado sira qual basta imessage k magpadala ng photo 😊 and idk if may gumagamit pa pero yung memoji, cute paminsan

I had my Huawei Nova 3i since 2015 and only upgraded to a S23 last Christmas. I still have the Huawei and its still doing great.

In previous models, I would set it to save both HDR and non-HDR photo. So I could pick which one I liked better. Usually it was the non-HDR because it was more natural, but sometimes HDR if the scene was backlit.

It would be terrible if I could only have HDR only photos. At least you should be able to Edit the photo and tap “Remove HDR” or something.",This is part why I’m in no hurry to upgrade my iPhone 11. I’ve heard too many issues with overprocessed photos from iPhone 13.

Things are overly sharp as well. As SOON as you zoom a bit into an image, the resolution falls apart.

Apple's aggressive processing ruins the 13 Pro cameras imo. I've started using Lightroom or Halide to take photos seriously and these are much better camera apps.","I prefer the iPhone shot. Much more detail in the shadows.

Detail in bright parts is similar. I'd say the real difference would come if you introduced a 108 Megapixel shot from a current Samsung flagship.

[The 12S Ultra wipes the floor with it.](https://i.imgur.com/Kv1faTX.png)","The thing I notice the most is how much better the dynamic range of the iPhone is. Just look at the shadows and the darker parts of the shot relative to the Note. That is what newer phones get you for the most part because the sensors and lensing hasn't gotten dramatically better.

Also if you had a look OP theres been a few threads about this topic recently.","for me the difference was in the speed of taking a photo and how it focuses faster, also the video stabilization is way way better on the iphone better than any thing i have ever seen on an android phone, for the quality it’s debatable, some people may like others don’t.","I also came from Android, and picked the 12 Pro mostly due to the lidar assisted auto focus.  My old phone has more megapixels and when shooting RAW produced a ""real camera"" look.  However, 75% of action shots were out of focus.  My iPhone almost never misses.

I'd love to see your Note 8 vs iPhone in a more challenging comparison.  If you have a dog or a kid or something, indoor where light isn't too good.","There's only so much these phones and their processing, algorithms, AI, etc. can do with the tiny sensors they're limited to. Aside from slight differences in specific choices the algorithms make, photos from the last few generations of flagship phones all basically look comparable to me, especially in decently lit scenes. The only real spheres of distinction in the competition are going to be larger sensor sizes and/or processing on those fringe cases, like low light, multiple exposure stacking, etc. and even that's diminishing.

Personally, I find the iPhone's overall rendering of this scene to be more pleasing. A bit brighter, less contrast, a more neutral whitepoint, slightly less saturation.","I agree. I upgraded from 12pro for just the camera and was disappointed. Was expecting a big jump but will think the night/dark photos is where it has made more improvement. But yes sad to say the huge camera module didn’t really deliver a huge upgrade. And someone else mentioned focusing issue, I have that on the 13pro as well. It takes a while for it to focus or doesn’t at all and I have to tap and focus.","I just wish apple would let us disable the AI sharpening :(

Sometimes if you click on a photo immediately after taking it you can see it before the AI is applied. More noise, but lots sharper, which I prefer.","Fwiw, this is definitely a software thing with the iPhone’s baked in Smart HDR.

Learn what the words mean first. 

The shadows are all crushed on the Note 8 however. 

The iPhone has a significantly wider dynamic range (overprocessed, that’s true, as it is all software corrected) however pro modes can shoot RAW and then you can edit the exposure, whites, highlights, shadows and blacks for yourself. 

But yeah your definition of overblown is very incorrect",I definitely hope this is fixed on 14 Pro.

I think they both excel and suck in different ways. The Galaxy's shadows areas are just big blobs of darkness with no defined details where the iPhone shows detail. Some areas of the lighter parts of the image are lighter in the iPhone image. Both photos show overprocessing in the trees and grass. 

But otherwise I think you are greatly exaggerating how bad the iPhone image is. I only noticed the issues I did when I zoomed in, where the problems with the Galaxy image were obvious at any size - shadow areas have no definition.",Have you tried changing the settings so you are using “pro res” raw format pictures? They use a bigger File size but it’s “raw” so you can edit it in post production.,"It seems to me you prefer the post processing on the Note 8, and that’s valid! I always preferred Samsung’s processing of certain scenes (typically outdoors with mixed lighting) and preferred iPhone for portraits (the way Samsung processing lightens skin tone has always seemed bothersome to me) and low light situations. 

You shouldn’t have to download an app, but I find Halide to be the absolute best way to capture images on any smartphone. You can shoot RAW and have zero processing, then grade it yourself, have Halide handle it, or tweak their processing. 

Obviously this is a potentially extensive process, but if you care enough to note the differences and discuss them on Reddit, odds are you enjoy photography enough for the endeavor to be worth your time.",Reading this thread: clutches Nokia 808 Pureview closer *I’ll never let you go*,"After looking at the pictures, I much prefer the iPhone 13 image over the Samsung one","I wonder if it's the result of the iphone trying to make the shadowed area more visible/detailed, it applies the settings to the whole picture. Which is why the shadowed area on the iphone is much better. Did you tap the iphone camera to make it focus on the brighter area? I wonder if there is a default focus area where the samsung is working to focus just the bright spot and largely ignoring the shadow area, where as the default of the iphone is to look at the whole picture and try to bring up the worst parts of the image, which would affect the brighter parts. This comparison is a good example of the two cameras trying to do two different things. I also wonder if the now iOS settings of forcing default settings on the iphone camera would make the pictures more similar with a quick point and shoot. 

All that being said, the cameras on just about any phone haven't improved much for probably 90% of pictures in the last 5 years. The differences are in the last 10% of picture settings.","There's not a single overblown pixel in the 13PM shot.

Even when you watch reviews and read articles, you're having these reviewers look for nuanced details from photo to photo, and the results vary from scenario to scenario between one device to the next. I'm sure you're gonna get objectively better pictures from the newer device more consistently than you would the old, and the options are more vast, but aside from that, most people can't tell if they're not sitting there comparing shots between both phones, and even more so if it's posted on social media, which just compresses the hell out of it, anyways.","I tried to explain this to my friends when they gripe about their photos. Every single one of Apple’s commercials that show images “Shot on an IPhone” have a disclaimer that all of the photos were post-processed with software before being put in the ad.

Most of my photos look great on my phone, but once transferred to my PC lose a lot of their magic on a larger screen.","The iPhone photo is definitely not overblown. I opened it up in a photo processing app and it was a fairly normal histogram. The Samsung was way too dark by comparison with even crushed blacks. The iPhone photo looks better in general. It’s personal preference I guess. But if you want to compare scientifically as best you can, the iPhone has a more complete histogram if you will.","I suspect iPhones processing is done with viewing the image at 1x in mind. Would say 98% of pictures taken on a phone the users never zoom in. That's probaly why the sharpening is done so aggressively - so that at 1x it looks sharper than a competing phone. Zooming in on my 13pm is an absolute disaster and at first I thought I had a defective unit, especially coming from a pixel 6p. But once I stopped comparing zoomed in crops which I don't often need to do, I've found the images acceptable (although I still like the pixel 6p camera a bit more)",Disable Smart HDR.,"The Samsung is a better exposure, that’s all.

I’m not really sure how phones could get better from this point.","I’m part of the group that got an iPhone13 in July along with my wife.  The only reason we upgraded to the 13 is because we switched carriers to save money and got iPhone 13 at great deal; because we needed 5g phones. Something like $800 off.  

I think that carrier deals on iPhones is the main reason iPhone 13 sales are still relatively good. 

A lot of people, including myself (even though I a software engineer), don’t get too caught up in every new iPhone release.  

Because to be honest, iPhone upgrades are incremental and most people will have a hard time distinguishing the difference between the old and new iPhone.  

So if you have an iPhone that is more then three years old, like we do, then you may see a difference.  To be honest, my wife really doesn’t see that much of a difference between her old Xr and her 13.  I can tell the difference between my old 11 and 13, but it’s really not a night and day difference.  

Sure the screen is better and has 5g, but if the two phones weren’t right next to each other, it really not that big of a difference.

To be honest, there’s not a lot about the 14 lineup that has me excited, and knowing that Apple tends to drop the Pro variants of their previous lineup when a new one launches, I’d rather get an ever so slightly worse phone for less, than a slightly better phone for potentially much, much more.",If best buy do a deal like last year I’ll trade in my 13 pro in a heartbeat.,D'you reckon the 12 will get cheaper as soon as the 14 is anounced or nah?

On iOS, oh my.. click link —> opens in-app browser with YouTube -> click “open in safari” -> click open app -> YouTube app opens.

Dig around in the accessibility settings. You can, for example, add a menu with buttons to open the camera or take a screenshot (under accessibility > touch > ""assistive touch""). Then you can map triple click home to the assistive touch menu.

You can also assign a double or triple tap on the back of the phone to various functions (""back tap"").","You have a magsafe car mount? I'd be terrified on my phone falling and cracking or something.

That's probably the last really annoying thing I can think of.

All in all though, I really don't miss Android phones at all (well maybe a little), and I'm probably going to stick with iPhones for a good while. Especially since I actually liked it enough to get AirPods Pros to use with it. :')","I missed always on display so much that I went out of my way to buy an Apple Watch, lol

Thankfully I believe I made the right choice. I love the watch, but Jesus Apple, can we get always on display already?

I’ve always told people as a stand alone device — I’d take a Samsung note over an iPhone any day. But with the ecosystem, Apple is better. 

I just really really want Apple Pencil support on the phones. And then again, the always on displace. Give me usb-c, and iPhone would be my perfect phone","1. The home screen is IMO pretty terrible on iOS.  Putting aside not being able to put icons where you want just having them wrap from the top rather than the bottom is bad.  The screen is also no longer symetrical and that gap between the dock and first row really bugs me.  I think this is down to the underyling OS on which it is all built not changing much since the first iPhone.  I cannot imagine that design ever getting the thumbs up from SJ or JI
2. The new app draw is a step backwards IMO.  Really do not like it.
3. File browser - I am glad that iOS at least has one now, it is not very good though
4. Agree re notifications, not only is it a 2 stage process but you also have to go into each app to actually clear the badge.
5. Always on display 100%.  They want you to buy an apple watch
6. iCloud photos - no ability to delete the device copy only
7. Bluetooth audio restricted to 250kbps AAC only

&#x200B;

There is lot of good stuff for sure but #1 and 4 are continued frustrations for me and why I tend to enjoy using a droid more.","- I really wish iOS had an always-on display, it just eliminates the need to pick my phone up or tap the screen to see the time, the charge percentage, or to check if any notifications are waiting.

Same. Hopefully it really is coming to the 14 (Pro?) lineup.

- I miss the ability to customize or modify anything, every Android app has a settings page, and iOS apps leave you with what you get. I think we all saw this one coming.

Meh. Used to it. Plus, I still use Android alongside my Apple mobile devices, so I still have those to tinker with.

- The app library on iOS is the least straightforward thing. At best you can scroll to find apps in a list, at worst I am looking through icons feeling like I am looking for a puzzle piece.

I just never go there. I don't like looking at it. loll

- I wish iOS had the ability to change the grid size on the home screen and allowed apps to be placed where ever I wanted (I saw this coming.) Forcing apps to be placed at the top left, first, goes against reachability especially considering most users are likely using their right hand to navigate the OS. Also, editing the home screen can be a pain, I try to place an app and it moves literally everything or it puts the app in a folder.

It's even worse with the iPads' larger space. The one thing out of all that I want is, at least, to be able to place an app anywhere I want instead of justifying everything to the top-left corner. At the minimum. I mean, they did add the option for the URL field in Safari to be at the bottom. They should bring more features that follow suit. That also reminds me that I want to be able to swipe down on any of the Home screens to pull down the Notification window. I hate that I can't swap the function out with Searching for Apps. How useless.

- I can't easily swipe away notifications on iOS, it's a two-step process at least. Swipe, press clear. If it's a stack: swipe down, swipe again, clear. While iOS notifications are slowly improving they are still leagues behind Android.

Yeah, they need a clear all button already. Instead, it's a two-step process. Long-press an 'X' then clear all. But you can swipe away a whole group, if I'm remembering correctly. Just swipe the parent notification. I'm still waiting for a group notification to come up...

- Can't easily see the battery percentage.

Idk why they got rid of it. Actually, I think it was because of the notch. The option is still there (next to the battery icon) on non-notched iPhones. But they could easily just place it inside the battery icon.

- I miss being able to grab the text in the app switcher as well as having a button to take a screenshot.

You can use the Assistive Touch button to take a screenshot or even add it as a Back Tap.

- The button power/volume button placement has led to a few accidental screenshots, so it goes both ways I guess.

They're easily deletable before they auto-save.

- I miss the in-display fingerprint scanner particularly when it's laying down on a desk.

I personally prefer it in the Power Button.

- I can pull the control center down when the notification panel is down but not vice versa. Just feels inconsistent.

I like Xiaomi's implementation where, while one is pulled down, you can swipe sideways over to the other, and vice-versa.

- The keyboard scrolling is a lot easier to use on Android. With iOS I have to hold down the spacebar for a second before I can scroll and then the scrolling is significantly faster than I would have expected.
There's no hide keyboard button. I deeply miss that small arrow at the bottom of the screen, it turns out I used that far more than I expected.

What bugs me more is that I can't just tap where I want the cursor to be. Definitely needs a hide button. Also, reminds me of the rotate button that briefly appears when you're rotating your device even when the orientation is locked (since I hate Auto-rotate) which I want.

I do hate how fast it scrolls on Android though. I'm always overscrolling.

- USB-C; It just seems odd to not be the standard since like 4 years ago.

I guess they're still making a load of money, licensing out MFi.

- I miss the ability to control my smart lights from the notification panel/control center.

You still can from Control Center. Or are they not compatible with Home Kit? If not, they may have a Widget that has to be added to the Widget pane (to the left of the Home screen/s).

- I'd like the ability to change what a double press of the home button is, preferably to open the camera quicker.

The Power/Side button? When you're in an app, I guess you'll just have to add it to Control Center. When on the Home screeen/s, just have it in the dock. If you're on the lock screen, it's a quick swipe to the left (from right edge). Or, again, add it to the Assistive Touch button or as a Back Tap.

- Finally, I really miss the message that would pop up after setting an alarm telling me how long until my alarm goes off.

Was thinking if that was an Android thing or a Pixel thing. Tried it on a few of my Androids (Pixel 2 & 3, Galaxy S22U, Xiaomi 12SU), and noticed it.

Not what you asked for, but I've learned to put most-frequently used apps on first page in folders and the rest I access via spotlight. Never used the App Library since it's useless for me as well.

>I can't easily swipe away notifications on iOS

It's not meant to be managed as much I think. Since it doesn't actually show anything in the status bar like on android, it's out-of-sight, out-of-mind. New ones are at the top and if you don't want to interact with it just leave it there. Only when it accumulates then you clear it with the X once every few hours. I prefer it like that now.

>Can't easily see the battery percentage.

You don't need to since newer phones usually last a whole day whatever you do. At least that's what Apple wants you to think and only charge or turn on power saving when it drops below certain percentage. But I understand those who want to know though.

>I miss being able to grab the text in the app switcher

One work-around is to take a screenshot, tap the mini-screenshot on the lower left, then long-press any text you want (in iOS that supports live text). Then you can delete the screenshot.

>The keyboard scrolling is a lot easier to use on Android. With iOS I have to hold down the spacebar for a second before I can scroll and then the scrolling is significantly faster than I would have expected.

I agree. I really miss 3D Touch because of its instant scrolling by just pressing hard instead of waiting. That being said, scrolling on iOS is much better for longer texts because you can jump across lines whereas on Android it frustrated me that it only scrolled through the same line, making it much harder to reach another line.

>There's no hide keyboard button. I deeply miss that small arrow at the bottom of the screen, it turns out I used that far more than I expected.

You can press anywhere above the keyboard to hide the keyboard as well. 

>I will miss the astrophotography mode from the Pixel, I didn't use it often but it worked really well and yielded impressive results that even friends that are passionate iPhone users were impressed by.

Night mode on iPhone 13 is amazing too, especially with a tripod so you get 30s shutter (hand-held you only get 10s).

>I miss the ability to control my smart lights from the notification panel/control center.

As others have said, if you used Homekit-supported devices you could control them from the control center.

>I'd like the ability to change what a double press of the home button is, preferably to open the camera quicker.

The biggest thing I miss, and I don't consider it trivial at all, is losing access to web based messaging.  If you have never had it, you have no idea what you are missing and just how convenient it really is.  As much as I like using this iPhone that is probably the one thing that will drive me back to Android sooner rather than later.","One thing I miss is, I haven’t found a good food journal.

The iPhone 14 is essentially the same as the iPhone 13 but with an extra GPU core and slightly better cameras (f stop). It’s not really worth upgrading if you’re on a 12 or 13. 

It might be worth upgrading from 11 and below. I am upgrading from a XR.

Now it's back to the way it was. Parking lots that would be completely full in 2020 are now empty with just my car.

- The 120hz screen is very noticable. If you have never experienced 120hz, you need to. Everything is smooth and you notice the difference right away when moving around through apps and photos

- This is my first time experiencing the multiple cameras. The pictures and videos I am able to take are incredible to see. I'm used to the single camera and this is just game changing to me. 

I guess if I could think of one ""con"" that I've had is that the phone is big. Now yes, I knew it would be big because it's a ""Max"", but I was still pretty surprised to see just how big it was in my pocket.

Final attempt I used a different card and it went through still with Sept 24th delivery date. Still overall way easier than trying to find Avengers Endgame tickets.

The rep I had had only worked at Apple for a month so she was a bit green. Everything went though, trade in, etc. the part I’m confused at is after they’ve accepted my phone trade in then do my phone setup how do they get around the 2FA that redirects to my home laptop? Anyhow finished setup at home, Mac backup recovery didn’t work, iCloud did. Apple Watch couldn’t connect right then got stuck in a loop until I factory reset it.

iCloud restored probably less than half the logins/passwords associated with my apps which is a major pain in the ass to get everything setup manually.

I currently have an iPhone X, and it is the perfect size for me. But I did consider the cost of actually getting the Pro, and it made think that it's just a bit more to get the Pro Max, a phone that would last more in terms of battery life. I did like the big screen of the Pro Max, but I'm afraid the phone won't be comfortable to use on an everyday basis.","Pretty sure UPS lost my package, talked to the driver for a sec while he was dropping off another package and he said he would come back if it's in the truck but also mentioned something about some of the apple packages being missing, this is great","UPS delivery is terrible!!! I was expecting to receive my new phone on the 24th (Friday) but the delivery driver put a sticker on my door even tho the package didn't require a signature. I didn't want this to happen again, so I changed my delivery address to the UPS Access Point and it was supposed to be delivered there today by 7PM (Monday). Well, my shipment was processing all day at a nearby UPS facility, so I called them to ask if they knew when my package would finally be delivered. I was told it was already in the van on the way to me. And now it’s 9PM and I can see my package has been refused and they are sending it back to Apple without any reason. WTF

I hope they keep making the Minis.","An explanation of UPS shipping to help you from the “Preparing to ship” state. From China, customs clearance is performed at the airport (VHHH “CHEK LAP KOK” most of the time). Most UPS flights out of China form here (with significant Apple deliveries) are for Anchorage, Cologne(Germany) and Honolulu (via Las Angeles). The vast majority of US and Canadian orders will pass through Anchorage, from there on, I can’t comment. Canadians will most likely get their shipment earlier if not the day it arrives on the continent. More often than not, the Europeans have a much more efficient system, especially if you live in Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland or Sweden, if that’s the case, you’ll have a higher than 80 percent chance of your shipment arriving within 24 hours of it touching down in Cologne. I have no consistent data to provide on Honolulu, sorry.

Edit: if you want to try and track your flight down. Keep in mind, for some reason, UPS tracking is updated upon radio handoff form VHHH, not upon loading onto the airplane. So keep the roughly 8 minute deviation in mind. I’ll also add that some flights to Cologne go via Dubai, this usually has no delay effects.","Just ordered iPhone 13 Pro 128 Sierra Blue, arriving after 45 days.","Guess I lucked out big time.

Most years I favourite the item but then you have to tap on the 'Add AppleCare?' and confirm that I do want to trade in my old phone (I'm not sure about the US, but in the UK they send you a kit when your new phone is dispatched, and then refund the trade-in fee to your payment card).

I've gone Max in Graphite because two years ago I got green, and last year I got the dark blue, but both times it's lived in a case and not once has the colour been seen!","My wife and I both got our 13 Pro Max 256gig Sierra blue pre-orders in and they’ll arrive by next Friday 9/24 !

We are doing the iPhone upgrade program yet during the checkout it kept giving my wife and I errors trying to check out with our Apple Card’s. Said payment error or something. Re entered it a few times. Still error.

We needed up using a diff cc and it went through.",WTF iUP just flat out refuses to work even though I went through the pre-approval process days ago.

Multiple devices.,"Trying to do the iPhone Upgrade Program, but Apple is ""Unable to reach carrier, please try again"". Fuck me.

Edit: Lot's of issues going on today, a few which were my fault.

1. I owed one remaining payment due to getting my phone in October last year. I contacted Citizens One and they told me if I made an early payment, it would not go through until Monday and I wouldn't be able to pre-order until then.
2. Contacted Apple and they told me if I filled out the pre-pre-order I would be fine.
3. I pre-pre-ordered but forgot to unfreeze my credit reports, so my loan was denied on my first check out attempt.
4. I unfroze my credit reports, cancelled my pre-pre-order, redid the process and it kept autofilling my data line from T-Mobile (free line from them that I use for Data so I get kickback on my primary/voice line), and I was unable to change my phone number/T-Mobile social.
5. Turned off my data line and switched everything to my normal T-Mobile account, but then it appears the T-Mobile server was down and it could not connect to T-Mobile. After around 5 straight minutes of it repeatedly failing, it let me skip it and said I would have to manually set up my phone when it comes, perhaps related to the eSIM issue above?
6. Ran into the Apple Card issue so many others did, eventually just used a different credit card (RIP 3% cash back on my initial payment)
   1. **Note to points 1 &2:** It did call out that I had to make an additional payment to upgrade and charged me during the checkout for my 12th payment as well as my first payment & taxes.
7. My pre-order date slipped to the October 6th timeframe unfortunately
8. Didn't get an email confirmation initially and pre-order did not appear in ""My Orders"" in my Apple Store app, queue panic that it didn't go through.

Eventually, 30 minutes or so later I  got a confirmation email that showed my delivery as the day of September 24th! My loan confirmation came through and I was able to add the loan to my Citizens One account on the website and update my payment method to my Apple Card there for all future payment.

**Lessons Learned:**

* If I'm short a payment, Apple with charge me for it during checkout.
* Unfreeze all 3 credit reports ahead of time, not sure which one Apple/Citizens One uses
* Turn off my data line so it doesn't pull in that information ahead of time and also make sure I have the last 4 of my Dad's social ahead of time since he is the primary owner of our family plan, pretty sure this was still an issue with T-Mobile though since it failed with both the last 4 of mine and my dad's SSN
* Always have a backup payment card ready! I had to scramble to find my wallet to get another credit card, and then also go to my bank to ""Unlock"" that credit card.
* During the pre-pre-order, I also realized that for whatever reason, I have two Citizens One accounts (one was my email username without \*@icloud.com and one was my full email which confused me. The first has my last 3-4 Upgrade Loans on it, and the other has my most recent loan on it. The loans are not automatically tied to any account, but when you login you can add a new loan to it.
   * Also had my Citizens One account locked while trying to login. Apparently the user name is case sensitive and for whatever reason the first letter of my email was capitalized, which led to me locking my account.
      * **Note:** You can call Citizens One to unlock your account, rather than waiting the 2 hours for it to unlock.",Anyone figure out a way to get their Apple Card to work?,Dates are starting to slip for all except gold.,"Managed to get the pro 256 , but had an issue with Apple pay.

I paid $200 to upgrade with the iPhone Upgrade Program but I did it with my Double Cash card from Citi as the Apple Card wouldn't go through despite multiple attempts. It's not much, but it stings.
