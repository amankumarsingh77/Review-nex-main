You could do worse.","Switched from a base 13 to a 15 Pro and I love it. I wouldn‚Äôt say the phone is *very* different but the changes are very welcome and  it‚Äôs fun to use it.

Idk if I can actually answer your question for you.

 It would cost you 80 USD to have the battery swapped out in the 13. If the 13 is still good otherwise, you could keep using it another year or two.

That being said, look around eBay or Facebook marketplace etc and see how much your phone would fetch if you sold it. Apple trade in won‚Äôt give you as much as you would get otherwise. But being that it‚Äôs not a 13 pro, it may be worth looking into selling, and if you get a good price then why not upgrade. Providing you can afford the upgrade and don‚Äôt finance it. My rule is that unless it‚Äôs something like a car or a house and you can‚Äôt afford buying it without financing, then you don‚Äôt NEED it.","Yes, especially if you take lots of pictures.",I would say so but i just upgraded from 12 pm to 15pm and the only difference is Dynamic Island.

It‚Äôs nice, but the only things I like more are the camera, USB-C and the weight of the phone. If you are coming from a regular 13, then the screen will be a nice upgrade, too. Oh, and 256GB minimum size for storage would be another reason to upgrade (plus, you can always easily plug in more storage via the USB port without needing a dongle). 

If you have a regular 6.1‚Äù 13, then the 15PM is a worthy upgrade, especially if you like to take video and pictures.","You can, if you feel like it.

It's a great device, barely feeling it in my hand/pocket, the MagSafe feature is so cool, the phone never lagged, it actually beat one of my gaming phones (a Redmagic 6s Pro) in some graphics benchmarking tests. I highly recommend the 13 mini and would have instantly preordered a 15 mini, if Apple would have released it.
 On another note: doesn't Apple see how many iPhone 13 mini users there are?

Impossible na walang wear and tear at 100% ka padin after 2 years as long as ginagamit mo yun phone. As long as charging/discharing ang battery, it will lose capacity no matter what you do. Ang pwede mo lang gawin is pabagalin yung pagdegrade ng battery.

Heat ang kalaban ng battery. Fast charging will heat it slightly, wireless charging will heat it. Playing games will heat it. Long video recording will heat it. Lahat ng pwede mong gawin, will heat the battery ever so slightly.","Pinakamabisang paraan is huwag mo icheck batt health mo. Nasa psychological lang yan. Gamitin mo sa kung saang paraan mo gustong gamitin. Pag masyadong kang conscious sa batt health mo, di mo fully ma eenjoy ang phone mo. For example, may nabasa ka na dapat 50% nakacharge kana, it means na if may ginagawa ka pero almost 50%na batt health mo, then hahanap kana ng outlet/pb para makapagcharge and in that case hindi mo talaga ineenjoy fully yung phone mo.",Charge at 30-40% then charge to 80%,"Batteries are consumable po, replacement at service centers will cost only around 5k.

Batteries degrade naturally and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to expect that you can maintain it at 100% especially if you use it as it is intended to be used.","I currently use an IP 13 too, in just a span of 7 months my batt health was 90%. Its been a year and still in 90%. Just use it like how its suppose to and relax","Been at 100% with the IP 14 Pro Max for 6 months now.

Imagine months sa kanya phone pero 100% pa rin.

1. Charge whenever you can. Kahit anong percent basta may charger go. 

2. Never ever gagamitin phone ng naka charge

3. Wag paaabutin ng 20%. 30 pa lang charge mo na.

4. Once mag 100 tanggalin mo na sa charger. Or ako parang months na never ko na 100% pero keri lang. 

5. Wag na wag mag oover charge.

Yun lang.","Just use it whenever and however you want. I did these ‚Äútips‚Äù sa iphone 13 ko. Never nag below 20%, scheduled na 7 pm mag charge up to 90-92%, hindi ginagamit while charging, but still, the battery degraded how it was expected to degrade within a year. Don‚Äôt be TOO concerned about it, it‚Äôs natural for a battery to degrade. Ma ruruin lang yung experience mo kapag inisip mo yun nang inisip (like what happened to me).","Yung wala nang isip-isip na paraan:
Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging > turn on Optimized Battery Charging.

Your phone is smart enough to know your charging habits, and will adjust charging speeds and rates and all of that accordingly. It knows you don‚Äôt use your phone when asleep, so it stops at 80% until before you wake up.

Kung praning ka pa rin:
NEVER use wireless charging.

Heat is bad for batteries. Wireless chargers generate heat since they‚Äôre more inefficient than wired charging.

But really, just use your phone as you will. Sayang sa headspace kung ang dami mong iniisip.","If you really want to take this route, aside from the tips of the previous users na hanggang 80% lang charging at di bababa 20%

The best advice I could give you is to use the phone however you want and not be paranoid about its battery health at all. Regardless of how you use it, it will still degrade eventually","wag mo po gamitin sure 100%. kidding aside proper charging lang pero wag mo na masyado isipin yang battery health.

Char

Kakaswitch ko lang from 14 Pro to S23U. And mas okay para sakin tbh. Wala kasi gamit sakin ang iMessage, FaceTime. Airdrop for travels lang. 

If manggagaling kang Android, you'll feel really restricted sa iPhone. Ang daming pindutin sa iPhone bago ka makarating sa paroroonan. Hahaha",Even an Iphone 11 is enough for the majority of the users.,"If we're going with the original question, the answer is YES. iPhone 13 would still be usable for at least 3 more years. I know a good amount of people that still use the iPhone X in 2023 and it still does the job for them. With that in mind, iPhone 13 is still far from being obsolete imo.

Regarding the S23 v iPhone 13:
Buying an iPhone is like buying a Rolls Royce; the car is expensive, reliable, and has good features. However, you won't dare alter what's under the hood. An android phone (S23) on the other hand, is like a Nissan Skyline GT-R in a sense that you can customize the heck out of it.

So if you like personalizing your phone and doing all kinds of stuff with it, get the android. Otherwise, get the iPhone.","go ka na for iPhone. I was in the same dilemma a month ago. Pero i went with the same device, iphone 13. Pag nag android ka ulit hahanap-hanapin mo ulit ang iOS. At least pag nanawa ka with ur iphone pwede mo ibenta then buy the s23.",Yes even nga iphone 11.. pwede pa ngayon. Hehe,"I love android's openness but when my bank apps refuse to open just because enabled ang dev options, i shifted to iphone. Closed os lang din pala e de mag iphone na.","Based from your use case, yep the base 13 would still be worth it. S23 is also a good choice because of its specs and the higher refresh rate screen. 

If you‚Äôre really interested in dipping your toe sa Apple echo system, 13 is a good entry point. Only go with s23 if you really want that higher refresh rate (personally I would always pick the one with a higher refresh rate since sanay na ako lol, that‚Äôs why I went with the pro lineup).","if you're more have a socmed or photos person go for the iPhone. If hindi mo hilig mga yan, go for the S23",2nd hand sa greenhills. Magdala ka na lang ng tropa na marunong tumingin,"The IP13 is worth it for the Factime/iMessage alone. I use my phone to communicate with my family and partner who are all using iOS. Messenger, Viber, and TG sucks compared to iMessage.","Yup worth it paaa

Based sa usage mo ip since gusto mo lng ata na gumagana / everyday na phone ( di ka masyado maphone ) 

May facetime pa kayo ( facetime lng malinaw na chat apps pag mayos internet try it yourself )","Yes worth it ang iPhone 13. Got an iPhone 13 a year ago. It is still smooth and in good shape. Feature wise, naka iPhone kasi family member ko, so madali na mag message and especially sharing photos and video with AirDrop. Goods din camera nya, kahit walang ProRaw or Raw format sa camera app, goods din. Great battery life, great screen, great experience. So far yan masasabi ko","Being someone who always prefers an android over iphones, I'd go with android. BUT, if you are into the quality of photo and videos, go with an iphone. Iba talaga quality kahit Iphone 13 pa yan.

We have tested several top of the line phones vs iphones iba talaga ung photo, mas maganda pag iphone.","If mostly ios gamit ng friends and family, yes worth it.","I‚Äôm running an iPhone 12 Pro. It still feels like it‚Äôs new and no complaints from me. I can imagine a 13 is going to do much better

Other than airdrop. One of the features that I use the most with family is shared library. Instead of having to basically share pictures so everyone has a copy, this lets pictures be automatically shared depending on the settings you‚Äôve set, or even just set pictures to be immediate added into the library. Pretty nice",iPhone is worth it. I am actually still using iPhone 11 - I bought it at the time na lumabas yung iP12. üòÖ Still worth it!!,YESSS my colleague bought an iphone 13 few months ago. She likes it naman! If u can pa gawin mo na pro max! Sulit na sulit naman for the battery,"Coming from iPhone 7 Plus, upgrading to iPhone 13 this year was worth it for me. As far as iOS updates go, my iPhone 7 Plus is still receiving iOS 15 updates with the latest one being 15.8. Bought that last December 2016 and it still works in 2023, problem is the battery is shit that it needs servicing, planning on changing it soon din since it is still decent naman but as far as the other apps go like mobile games, medyo demanding na sa phone so the 13 was the upgrade that was needed. Didn't go to 14 since same lang na chipset, didn't get the Pro and Pro Max versions since I didn't need the extra camera. Base model is just as fine. Kinda wish there was a 13 Plus kaso 13 Mini yung alternative, almost bought that instead kaso talo sa battery but to each their own naman pagdating sa iba't-ibang iPhone models.","I used to buy high end phones..

The optimization on iPhone is far ahead than android that's why it only requires few rams (I both own S23 and 14PM).  
For longevity and smoothness, go with iphone. Even with flagship android, I still feel the never ending beta-like experience with android while IOS felt more complete.  


Its also a huge problem if you have a person who's an IOS user and it is truly useful to you once you have it. My wife owns 13PM and the smooth connectivity is on another level. The quality of Facetime is immaculate, video and photos we're lossless when passing it with IOS.","im using ip13pro for two years now. Did you know that ip13 according to livemint that iPhone 13, which was launched in 2021, secured the first position as the best-selling model, while the iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max followed at second and third positions, respectively.

Kapag naka experience kanlang ng 120hz tsaka mo palang manonotice na iba ang 60hz. and with the ram? you really dont need that much RAM sa phone. and it wont matter sa iphones kase every apps run smoothly even with games. Kahit mag switch apps ka from time to time, it'll ruj smoothly.

as a techy person, RAM variants sa phone talaga ung di ko magets sa phones like as if it's a PC. u can only do much sa phone and pagdating naman sa phone u wont run multiple programs all at once. Unlike sa PC na RAM really matters kase system processes and programs consumes a lot of memory to run.

Yup I am using ip13 and useful siya. Clearer photos and videos ang nasheshare niyo na memories with each other kasi napepreserve yung quality.

The only iphones that are worth it to me are pros and pro maxes since those have 120hz displays.","The great thing about iOS is not the specs. Sure, Android phones has better specs in paper but what matters most is how the phone functions. In iPhone, every app works seamlessly because of the great hardware-software communication. In Android, most apps are buggy because of Android OS in different brands has different features and codes that makes it difficult for App developers to integrate it perfectly with Android. Also, the ease of use by the Apple ecosystem is the best. I own an Android and an iPhone but the simplicity of Apple's devices and the longevity is the best. Not to mention, it's resell value. You'll still get a decent amount of money should you decide to sell your Apple device and upgrade.","I just want to add on the diff apps you are using.

Just look at the shadows and the darker parts of the shot relative to the Note. That is what newer phones get you for the most part because the sensors and lensing hasn't gotten dramatically better.

Also if you had a look OP theres been a few threads about this topic recently.","for me the difference was in the speed of taking a photo and how it focuses faster, also the video stabilization is way way better on the iphone better than any thing i have ever seen on an android phone, for the quality it‚Äôs debatable, some people may like others don‚Äôt.","I also came from Android, and picked the 12 Pro mostly due to the lidar assisted auto focus.  My old phone has more megapixels and when shooting RAW produced a ""real camera"" look.  However, 75% of action shots were out of focus.  My iPhone almost never misses.

I'd love to see your Note 8 vs iPhone in a more challenging comparison.  If you have a dog or a kid or something, indoor where light isn't too good.","There's only so much these phones and their processing, algorithms, AI, etc. can do with the tiny sensors they're limited to. Aside from slight differences in specific choices the algorithms make, photos from the last few generations of flagship phones all basically look comparable to me, especially in decently lit scenes. The only real spheres of distinction in the competition are going to be larger sensor sizes and/or processing on those fringe cases, like low light, multiple exposure stacking, etc. and even that's diminishing.

Personally, I find the iPhone's overall rendering of this scene to be more pleasing. A bit brighter, less contrast, a more neutral whitepoint, slightly less saturation.","I agree. I upgraded from 12pro for just the camera and was disappointed. Was expecting a big jump but will think the night/dark photos is where it has made more improvement. But yes sad to say the huge camera module didn‚Äôt really deliver a huge upgrade. And someone else mentioned focusing issue, I have that on the 13pro as well. It takes a while for it to focus or doesn‚Äôt at all and I have to tap and focus.","I just wish apple would let us disable the AI sharpening :(

Sometimes if you click on a photo immediately after taking it you can see it before the AI is applied.

I think they both excel and suck in different ways. The Galaxy's shadows areas are just big blobs of darkness with no defined details where the iPhone shows detail. Some areas of the lighter parts of the image are lighter in the iPhone image. Both photos show overprocessing in the trees and grass. 

But otherwise I think you are greatly exaggerating how bad the iPhone image is. I only noticed the issues I did when I zoomed in, where the problems with the Galaxy image were obvious at any size - shadow areas have no definition.",Have you tried changing the settings so you are using ‚Äúpro res‚Äù raw format pictures? They use a bigger File size but it‚Äôs ‚Äúraw‚Äù so you can edit it in post production.,"It seems to me you prefer the post processing on the Note 8, and that‚Äôs valid! I always preferred Samsung‚Äôs processing of certain scenes (typically outdoors with mixed lighting) and preferred iPhone for portraits (the way Samsung processing lightens skin tone has always seemed bothersome to me) and low light situations. 

You shouldn‚Äôt have to download an app, but I find Halide to be the absolute best way to capture images on any smartphone. You can shoot RAW and have zero processing, then grade it yourself, have Halide handle it, or tweak their processing.

Which is why the shadowed area on the iphone is much better. Did you tap the iphone camera to make it focus on the brighter area? I wonder if there is a default focus area where the samsung is working to focus just the bright spot and largely ignoring the shadow area, where as the default of the iphone is to look at the whole picture and try to bring up the worst parts of the image, which would affect the brighter parts. This comparison is a good example of the two cameras trying to do two different things. I also wonder if the now iOS settings of forcing default settings on the iphone camera would make the pictures more similar with a quick point and shoot.

Zooming in on my 13pm is an absolute disaster and at first I thought I had a defective unit, especially coming from a pixel 6p.

I‚Äôm not really sure how phones could get better from this point.","I‚Äôm part of the group that got an iPhone13 in July along with my wife.  The only reason we upgraded to the 13 is because we switched carriers to save money and got iPhone 13 at great deal; because we needed 5g phones. Something like $800 off.  

I think that carrier deals on iPhones is the main reason iPhone 13 sales are still relatively good. 

A lot of people, including myself (even though I a software engineer), don‚Äôt get too caught up in every new iPhone release.  

Because to be honest, iPhone upgrades are incremental and most people will have a hard time distinguishing the difference between the old and new iPhone.  

So if you have an iPhone that is more then three years old, like we do, then you may see a difference.  To be honest, my wife really doesn‚Äôt see that much of a difference between her old Xr and her 13.  I can tell the difference between my old 11 and 13, but it‚Äôs really not a night and day difference.

To be honest, there‚Äôs not a lot about the 14 lineup that has me excited, and knowing that Apple tends to drop the Pro variants of their previous lineup when a new one launches, I‚Äôd rather get an ever so slightly worse phone for less, than a slightly better phone for potentially much, much more.",If best buy do a deal like last year I‚Äôll trade in my 13 pro in a heartbeat.,D'you reckon the 12 will get cheaper as soon as the 14 is anounced or nah?

It‚Äôll tell you by being yellow or red if you‚Äôre low.","Mess around with shortcuts, sadly the side menu on iPhone don‚Äôt have popular app smart controls like iPad but shortcuts are fucking cool when you figure them out, I can control my ford, control lights with Siri.

If you siri for an alarm in x minutes it will repeat it in loud mode.

iMessages sync between phone and iPad and easily transfer between devices if you lose it.

And another quickie I saw not being able to modify apps, that can be done in settings and with a long tap in the Home Screen","> I can pull the control center down when the notification panel is down but not vice versa. Just feels inconsistent.

It's sort of a layered model that came around with iOS 7. The control center is conceptually ""on top of"" the notification center.

> I miss the ability to control my smart lights from the notification panel/control center.

Settings > control center > add ""Home"". Unfortunately it tries to be smart and guess what accessories you want there.

> I'd like the ability to change what a double press of the home button is, preferably to open the camera quicker.

Dig around in the accessibility settings. You can, for example, add a menu with buttons to open the camera or take a screenshot (under accessibility > touch > ""assistive touch""). Then you can map triple click home to the assistive touch menu.

You can also assign a double or triple tap on the back of the phone to various functions (""back tap"").","You have a magsafe car mount? I'd be terrified on my phone falling and cracking or something.

I also switched to my first ever iPhone (and Apple product) with the 12 pro and FaceID has been one of those things I find myself actively praising to myself at least once a week still haha. Same thing with how well Bluetooth works, and ESPECIALLY the battery life which hasn't shown any sign of degradation after \~half a year unlike with almost every Android phone I've ever used.

Your complaints also pretty much fall in line with mine. In particular, I miss being able to just swipe left when a notification appears while I'm actively using the phone. Instead I now have to swipe down, then press the X button to clear it? Way too long in comparison to what other phones do. Other than that, weirdly, I also really miss the ""\_\_ hours until alarm"" message. Oh yeah, I also take, save a lot of videos from Snapchat and share them to friends on Discord and for some reason mp4 files from Snapchat specifically on iPhone don't show up as embedded videos. Instead, you have to download the file unless I save it from Snapchat memories to my camera roll, which means I have two of the same videos in my camera roll except one is shareable on Discord and the other not. That's probably the last really annoying thing I can think of.

All in all though, I really don't miss Android phones at all (well maybe a little), and I'm probably going to stick with iPhones for a good while. Especially since I actually liked it enough to get AirPods Pros to use with it. :')","I missed always on display so much that I went out of my way to buy an Apple Watch, lol

Thankfully I believe I made the right choice. I love the watch, but Jesus Apple, can we get always on display already?

I‚Äôve always told people as a stand alone device ‚Äî I‚Äôd take a Samsung note over an iPhone any day. But with the ecosystem, Apple is better. 

I just really really want Apple Pencil support on the phones. And then again, the always on displace. Give me usb-c, and iPhone would be my perfect phone","1. The home screen is IMO pretty terrible on iOS.  Putting aside not being able to put icons where you want just having them wrap from the top rather than the bottom is bad.  The screen is also no longer symetrical and that gap between the dock and first row really bugs me.  I think this is down to the underyling OS on which it is all built not changing much since the first iPhone.  I cannot imagine that design ever getting the thumbs up from SJ or JI
2. The new app draw is a step backwards IMO.  Really do not like it.
3. File browser - I am glad that iOS at least has one now, it is not very good though
4. Agree re notifications, not only is it a 2 stage process but you also have to go into each app to actually clear the badge.
5. Always on display 100%.  They want you to buy an apple watch
6. iCloud photos - no ability to delete the device copy only
7. Bluetooth audio restricted to 250kbps AAC only

&#x200B;

There is lot of good stuff for sure but #1 and 4 are continued frustrations for me and why I tend to enjoy using a droid more.","- I really wish iOS had an always-on display, it just eliminates the need to pick my phone up or tap the screen to see the time, the charge percentage, or to check if any notifications are waiting.

Same. Hopefully it really is coming to the 14 (Pro?) lineup.

- I miss the ability to customize or modify anything, every Android app has a settings page, and iOS apps leave you with what you get. I think we all saw this one coming.

Meh. Used to it. Plus, I still use Android alongside my Apple mobile devices, so I still have those to tinker with.

- The app library on iOS is the least straightforward thing. At best you can scroll to find apps in a list, at worst I am looking through icons feeling like I am looking for a puzzle piece.

I just never go there. I don't like looking at it. loll

- I wish iOS had the ability to change the grid size on the home screen and allowed apps to be placed where ever I wanted (I saw this coming.) Forcing apps to be placed at the top left, first, goes against reachability especially considering most users are likely using their right hand to navigate the OS. Also, editing the home screen can be a pain, I try to place an app and it moves literally everything or it puts the app in a folder.

It's even worse with the iPads' larger space. The one thing out of all that I want is, at least, to be able to place an app anywhere I want instead of justifying everything to the top-left corner. At the minimum. I mean, they did add the option for the URL field in Safari to be at the bottom. They should bring more features that follow suit. That also reminds me that I want to be able to swipe down on any of the Home screens to pull down the Notification window. I hate that I can't swap the function out with Searching for Apps. How useless.

- I can't easily swipe away notifications on iOS, it's a two-step process at least. Swipe, press clear. If it's a stack: swipe down, swipe again, clear. While iOS notifications are slowly improving they are still leagues behind Android.

Yeah, they need a clear all button already. Instead, it's a two-step process. Long-press an 'X' then clear all. But you can swipe away a whole group, if I'm remembering correctly. Just swipe the parent notification. I'm still waiting for a group notification to come up...

- Can't easily see the battery percentage.

Idk why they got rid of it. Actually, I think it was because of the notch. The option is still there (next to the battery icon) on non-notched iPhones. But they could easily just place it inside the battery icon.

- I miss being able to grab the text in the app switcher as well as having a button to take a screenshot.

You can use the Assistive Touch button to take a screenshot or even add it as a Back Tap.

- The button power/volume button placement has led to a few accidental screenshots, so it goes both ways I guess.

They're easily deletable before they auto-save.

- I miss the in-display fingerprint scanner particularly when it's laying down on a desk.

I personally prefer it in the Power Button.

- I can pull the control center down when the notification panel is down but not vice versa. Just feels inconsistent.

I like Xiaomi's implementation where, while one is pulled down, you can swipe sideways over to the other, and vice-versa.

- The keyboard scrolling is a lot easier to use on Android. With iOS I have to hold down the spacebar for a second before I can scroll and then the scrolling is significantly faster than I would have expected.
There's no hide keyboard button. I deeply miss that small arrow at the bottom of the screen, it turns out I used that far more than I expected.

What bugs me more is that I can't just tap where I want the cursor to be. Definitely needs a hide button. Also, reminds me of the rotate button that briefly appears when you're rotating your device even when the orientation is locked (since I hate Auto-rotate) which I want.

I do hate how fast it scrolls on Android though. I'm always overscrolling.

- USB-C; It just seems odd to not be the standard since like 4 years ago.

I guess they're still making a load of money, licensing out MFi.

- I miss the ability to control my smart lights from the notification panel/control center.

You still can from Control Center. Or are they not compatible with Home Kit? If not, they may have a Widget that has to be added to the Widget pane (to the left of the Home screen/s).

- I'd like the ability to change what a double press of the home button is, preferably to open the camera quicker.

The Power/Side button? When you're in an app, I guess you'll just have to add it to Control Center. When on the Home screeen/s, just have it in the dock. If you're on the lock screen, it's a quick swipe to the left (from right edge). Or, again, add it to the Assistive Touch button or as a Back Tap.

- Finally, I really miss the message that would pop up after setting an alarm telling me how long until my alarm goes off.

Was thinking if that was an Android thing or a Pixel thing. Tried it on a few of my Androids (Pixel 2 & 3, Galaxy S22U, Xiaomi 12SU), and noticed it.

Not what you asked for, but I've learned to put most-frequently used apps on first page in folders and the rest I access via spotlight. Never used the App Library since it's useless for me as well.

>I can't easily swipe away notifications on iOS

It's not meant to be managed as much I think. Since it doesn't actually show anything in the status bar like on android, it's out-of-sight, out-of-mind. New ones are at the top and if you don't want to interact with it just leave it there. Only when it accumulates then you clear it with the X once every few hours. I prefer it like that now.

>Can't easily see the battery percentage.

You don't need to since newer phones usually last a whole day whatever you do. At least that's what Apple wants you to think and only charge or turn on power saving when it drops below certain percentage. But I understand those who want to know though.

>I miss being able to grab the text in the app switcher

One work-around is to take a screenshot, tap the mini-screenshot on the lower left, then long-press any text you want (in iOS that supports live text). Then you can delete the screenshot.

>The keyboard scrolling is a lot easier to use on Android. With iOS I have to hold down the spacebar for a second before I can scroll and then the scrolling is significantly faster than I would have expected.

I agree. I really miss 3D Touch because of its instant scrolling by just pressing hard instead of waiting. That being said, scrolling on iOS is much better for longer texts because you can jump across lines whereas on Android it frustrated me that it only scrolled through the same line, making it much harder to reach another line.

>There's no hide keyboard button. I deeply miss that small arrow at the bottom of the screen, it turns out I used that far more than I expected.

You can press anywhere above the keyboard to hide the keyboard as well. 

>I will miss the astrophotography mode from the Pixel, I didn't use it often but it worked really well and yielded impressive results that even friends that are passionate iPhone users were impressed by.

Night mode on iPhone 13 is amazing too, especially with a tripod so you get 30s shutter (hand-held you only get 10s).

Although I agree that the computational photography on some androids like pixel is probably better.

>I miss the ability to control my smart lights from the notification panel/control center.

As others have said, if you used Homekit-supported devices you could control them from the control center.

>I'd like the ability to change what a double press of the home button is, preferably to open the camera quicker.

Raising the phone which will turn on the lock screen and then swiping left is pretty easy too.

Also, when you share your photos and videos, they are downscaled. With Google Photos, shared photos and videos are in their original quality. That's really my biggest grip with my iPhone.","I miss my Google Assistant. Call screening, spam call rejection, and simple queries with squeeze-to-launch (Pixel phone). 

Notifications are still a mess on the iPhone. If I have a notification from, say, Instagram, and then I open the app from the notification, why does the notification still needs to be cleared manually??? üò≠","Dark Sky was one of my main reasons I switched to an iPhone 12 after my last 5 or so phones being android since the 3GS. Biggest reasons was OS support, got tired of maybe a 1 year of updates if I was lucky. 

Unfortunately Dark Sky is pretty crappy now. Curious if I‚Äôm alone in thinking that. I have a dog that freaks out in bad weather so I feel like I‚Äôm way more attentive to the app then most people. On android I used weather apps that used dark sky‚Äôs api, been using it since like 2017 or so 

The weather prediction is not only bad, but problematic. Pretty rare for me to actually get rain warnings anymore unless there‚Äôs a big system coming in and it doesn‚Äôt change for like ~12 hours before I get rain. Didn‚Äôt have rain in the forecast today, woke up to heavy rain, no warning notification and was told it would last 20 mins. Checked it again after 15 and it told me the rain was now gonna last 2 hours. Frequently have had issues with it saying there will be a short period of rain and then it suddenly doubles around when it was originally supposed to end. Had issues Saturday too, I was making plans with friends and had no rain chance in the forecast when I checked at ~7am and noon. Ended up raining from like 2pm to 330",Try adding a widget to the left side of your lock screen or home screen. Smartthings support‚Äôs it and you can access it from every screen.,"believe me, i wish iphone had a ‚Äúhide keyboard‚Äù button and i‚Äôve never used an android before",i feel sorry for him not waiting that one month for 14 pro,"You can search apps a couple different ways, you CAN swipe away notifications, there‚Äôs a pickup display where the screen comes on as soon as the phone is moved (not the same but close), idk what you mean by setting for apps but there‚Äôs a couple for each app in the main settings if you scroll down and click on the app, single swipe down on control center to see the exact percent (really no need to always know the EXACT percent but you can if you need to with a single swipe), you CAN put away the keyboard with a single swipe down, you can customize the control center any way you like with widgets their might be one for the lights idk. Finally what home button on the 13???

That‚Äôs the single biggest difference I‚Äôve noticed making the same switch as you.,Just made the switch myself! Android 12 had been a mess for me as my Pixel 3 became unstable and performance fell off a cliff. I bought a Galaxy S22 at release which was much better but it too still had hiccups and minor jank.

The biggest thing I miss, and I don't consider it trivial at all, is losing access to web based messaging.  If you have never had it, you have no idea what you are missing and just how convenient it really is.  As much as I like using this iPhone that is probably the one thing that will drive me back to Android sooner rather than later.","One thing I miss is, I haven‚Äôt found a good food journal. Being in the Samsung ecosystem for so long, I like how Samsung health lets you log food and breaks it down by minerals, vitamins, etc for the day.

Apple also has the delivery listed for the 1st, but then says it will be delivered between the 6th and the 11th. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","Ordered the 17th 30 min. after preorder launch on Apple Store app. PM13 Graphite 256GB, had delivery estimated at Oct 6-11. Shipped last night, Apple estimates arrival on Oct 5, but UPS has delivery scheduled for this Friday! Hope they‚Äôre right! As of an hour ago it just left China.",Oct 1 Verizon order (pro max) preparing to ship!,9/21 preorder Verizon 256 Pro Max..got my shipping info and arriving friday,Got it today! Preordered from Verizon the first day we could about 10:30 am. 13 pro max 1tb blue. Immediately ordered a different case. This thing is big and needs two hands to really use comfortably. I‚Äôm pretending it‚Äôs an iPhone/iPad mini combo. I use it nonstop so I‚Äôll appreciate the screen. Coming from the 11 pro max I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt remember how big these are but hey- it‚Äôs great for media consumption. Just something I had really not bothered to think about. I had a loopy case for my last one but this time trying a MagSafe magnetic pop socket that comes off for wireless charging. That should help with reaching the screen.,"Blue 128G iPhone Mini arrived today, original date was Oct 7 - 12. Coming from XR, it's so delightfully small and comfortable in my hands. I hope they keep making the Minis.","An explanation of UPS shipping to help you from the ‚ÄúPreparing to ship‚Äù state. From China, customs clearance is performed at the airport (VHHH ‚ÄúCHEK LAP KOK‚Äù most of the time). Most UPS flights out of China form here (with significant Apple deliveries) are for Anchorage, Cologne(Germany) and Honolulu (via Las Angeles). The vast majority of US and Canadian orders will pass through Anchorage, from there on, I can‚Äôt comment. Canadians will most likely get their shipment earlier if not the day it arrives on the continent. More often than not, the Europeans have a much more efficient system, especially if you live in Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland or Sweden, if that‚Äôs the case, you‚Äôll have a higher than 80 percent chance of your shipment arriving within 24 hours of it touching down in Cologne. I have no consistent data to provide on Honolulu, sorry.

Edit: if you want to try and track your flight down. Keep in mind, for some reason, UPS tracking is updated upon radio handoff form VHHH, not upon loading onto the airplane. So keep the roughly 8 minute deviation in mind. I‚Äôll also add that some flights to Cologne go via Dubai, this usually has no delay effects.","Just ordered iPhone 13 Pro 128 Sierra Blue, arriving after 45 days.","Guess I lucked out big time. My 13 mini sped from [Shanghai to my door in Arizona](https://imgur.com/a/YMknH9S) in 2 days flat!

status is processing","I‚Äôm surprised by how popular that Sierra blue is. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ not very good to me. I wonder if it‚Äôs just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe color‚Äù this year, or if everyone really likes it that much. I could just be in the minority on the color.",[deleted],iPhone 13 Pro Max 256 GB Gold GANGG WYA?,"Blows my mind how fucking easy this was for delivery in a week yet GPU‚Äôs, PS5 and Series X are still impossible to find for most people a year later. Yes it is apple who can pretty much make anything happen with money, but is there no chip shortage for them? 
I had to order a unlocked one as they refused to connect to my carrier but whatever. 

The demand is more than likely exponentially larger for the new phones than the aforementioned products as well but they can actually set up a working preorder system.","This thing was a shit show. Wouldn‚Äôt take my Apple Card, I tried it so many times, it said my loan was denied. Thankfully some commenters told me to restart the app and try again with a different card. Did that and it was a spin wheel for about 5 minutes, says it‚Äôs unsuccessful. I try again and it said preorders closed? I GIVE UP COMPLEYELY and then I get a confirmation email‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so it did go through?? Ugh","AT&T is giving me $800 for my X. For a 4 year old phone, this is awesome","After 6 years in android I pre ordered a 13 pro graphite 256. Excited , haven't had an iphone since iphone 6!","Went for a 13 Pro 128GB in Graphite.

Currently have an xr and I‚Äôm trading it in,Sierra blue gang let us rejoice!,"Almost had a heart attack. I go to my stoop and see a box the size of a phone.

They wouldn‚Äôt accept my apple card as the initial payment yet again, but otherwise seemed to be a smooth process.",Has anyone got an email confirmation yet? I have my order number but know email confirmation yet.,"Having the whole thing pre-saved in the app was such a good experience. I literally just had to confirm my Apple Pay payment and it went through. Most years I favourite the item but then you have to tap on the 'Add AppleCare?' and confirm that I do want to trade in my old phone (I'm not sure about the US, but in the UK they send you a kit when your new phone is dispatched, and then refund the trade-in fee to your payment card).

I've gone Max in Graphite because two years ago I got green, and last year I got the dark blue, but both times it's lived in a case and not once has the colour been seen!","My wife and I both got our 13 Pro Max 256gig Sierra blue pre-orders in and they‚Äôll arrive by next Friday 9/24 !

Now it‚Äôs saying my Apple Card information is incorrect when it‚Äôs not.,[deleted],I can‚Äôt checkout. It won‚Äôt use my Apple Card. Or any other card. Multiple devices.,"Trying to do the iPhone Upgrade Program, but Apple is ""Unable to reach carrier, please try again"". Fuck me.

Edit: Lot's of issues going on today, a few which were my fault.

1. I owed one remaining payment due to getting my phone in October last year. I contacted Citizens One and they told me if I made an early payment, it would not go through until Monday and I wouldn't be able to pre-order until then.
2. Contacted Apple and they told me if I filled out the pre-pre-order I would be fine.
3. I pre-pre-ordered but forgot to unfreeze my credit reports, so my loan was denied on my first check out attempt.
4. I unfroze my credit reports, cancelled my pre-pre-order, redid the process and it kept autofilling my data line from T-Mobile (free line from them that I use for Data so I get kickback on my primary/voice line), and I was unable to change my phone number/T-Mobile social.
5. Turned off my data line and switched everything to my normal T-Mobile account, but then it appears the T-Mobile server was down and it could not connect to T-Mobile. After around 5 straight minutes of it repeatedly failing, it let me skip it and said I would have to manually set up my phone when it comes, perhaps related to the eSIM issue above?
6. Ran into the Apple Card issue so many others did, eventually just used a different credit card (RIP 3% cash back on my initial payment)
   1. **Note to points 1 &2:** It did call out that I had to make an additional payment to upgrade and charged me during the checkout for my 12th payment as well as my first payment & taxes.
7. My pre-order date slipped to the October 6th timeframe unfortunately
8. Didn't get an email confirmation initially and pre-order did not appear in ""My Orders"" in my Apple Store app, queue panic that it didn't go through.

Eventually, 30 minutes or so later I  got a confirmation email that showed my delivery as the day of September 24th! My loan confirmation came through and I was able to add the loan to my Citizens One account on the website and update my payment method to my Apple Card there for all future payment.

**Lessons Learned:**

* If I'm short a payment, Apple with charge me for it during checkout.
* Unfreeze all 3 credit reports ahead of time, not sure which one Apple/Citizens One uses
* Turn off my data line so it doesn't pull in that information ahead of time and also make sure I have the last 4 of my Dad's social ahead of time since he is the primary owner of our family plan, pretty sure this was still an issue with T-Mobile though since it failed with both the last 4 of mine and my dad's SSN
* Always have a backup payment card ready! I had to scramble to find my wallet to get another credit card, and then also go to my bank to ""Unlock"" that credit card.
* During the pre-pre-order, I also realized that for whatever reason, I have two Citizens One accounts (one was my email username without \*@icloud.com and one was my full email which confused me. The first has my last 3-4 Upgrade Loans on it, and the other has my most recent loan on it. The loans are not automatically tied to any account, but when you login you can add a new loan to it.
   * Also had my Citizens One account locked while trying to login. Apparently the user name is case sensitive and for whatever reason the first letter of my email was capitalized, which led to me locking my account.
      * **Note:** You can call Citizens One to unlock your account, rather than waiting the 2 hours for it to unlock.",Anyone figure out a way to get their Apple Card to work?,Dates are starting to slip for all except gold.,"Managed to get the pro 256 , but had an issue with Apple pay.
