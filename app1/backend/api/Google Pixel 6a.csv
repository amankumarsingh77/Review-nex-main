"Pixel 6A performs really really bad in Google Maps, rerouting frequently and showing me on a different street, etc. My Pixel 6A is brand new and it works well except the GPS... it seems that this is a common issue when I searched Google and Reddit, and Pixel 7 series also have the same issue with the GPS chip. Is this happening with Pixel 8 series also???

google maps basically guesses which way i'm going. if i turn according to the directions, my position continues straight. if i ignore the directions and continue straight, it shows my position making the turn.

if i'm at a stop light, it will change and show me facing the other direction. if i'm on a frontage road, it will jump over to the highway, and vice versa. if i'm standing still, the location jumps around randomly within a 200 ft radius.

sometimes, the location just stops updating for up to 20 seconds.

i brought this up with support. they escalated it to a specialist, who after 12 days, finally has a response:

None have the emotional feel of the 6a. The displays on all the Pixels before the 8 series were only passably good - the rainbow effect occurs on them all, the 7 Pro less so, but it's still there.

I have the pixel 6a and. I'm ditching it... never getting a pixel again. There is the  slow charge issues and also getting charged in the first place by being finicky about connecting  to a  charger unless it's a QI (which works slower than molasses), besides being flaky when it wants to connect off and on to Android Auto. When it finally does work on Android auto the battery drain's faster than the usb charging, and of course, it dies and shuts off. The phone gets warm easily and then it won't charge at all. I'm so desperate. I put my air conditioning  full blast and hold my phone up to get it to cool off so it starts charging again.. This is f**king ridiculous!   I'm done with this phone!

The Pixel 6a plastic back scratches easily so I'm thinking I should slap a skin on it. However, I read somewhere that skins are not good for the 6a because it's going to peel off the paint used for the 6a's back cover upon removal.

Can anyone validate this?","a part of me wants to upgrade to the 6a (I have had a 4a for the last 2 years), but your post is the one of the few who say good things about battery life.

Another part of me wants to but the Samsung S23, but the price is too high and I need to think about it.",Can anyone speak for the build quality and long term reliability of Pixel devices and the 6a specifically? How long can I expect it to last without hardware issues?,"My experience with the Pixel 6 Pro was horrible.

Camera (3/5):
Shooting photos and videos with this phone main camera is amazing, even in low light. It would always impress me, the stabilization is also good. The downside is the ultra wide camera. Shooting videos in low light with the ultra wide camera results in a washed out video. The quality is so bad that it is embarrassing to call this a ""Pro"" version. My 3 years old OP8 (OnePlus 8) shoots a way better ultra wide video in low light, and the camera is the OP's weakest point... The front camera photos are underwhelming. The telephoto is great, however, I only got to test it in normal lighting.

Battery (1/5):
This is a 5000 mAh battery device, it should last you the whole day without any trouble. Left home with 72% charge on my OP8 and 78% on the Pixel. I used Google Maps on my OP8 for 1h34m, 30 minutes of it is probably searching for places, the rest was for navigating around the cities. On the other hand, I used the Pixel for taking a few photos and 2 short videos, not more than 10 minutes of usage. Used it for chatting for around 45 minutes. This was a 8 hour trip. The OP8 went down from 72 to 39, the pixel went down frok 78 to 32. 33% with 1h34m Maps vs 46% with 45 min of chatting and a few shots and 2 videos. I tried Anker's 30W charger, and it charged around 13% in 10 minutes ‚Äì definitely not 30W, my OP8 does 20% in 9 minutes. The phone's battery did well on Wi-Fi though, so the problem might be with it cellular receiver.

Software (2/5):
Google's phones are known for their ""software"". I am not impressed by it, not even a little bit. The camera app would crash so frequently that it got on my nerves. I bought this phone to take photos, and it has built its image on simply doing that, but they can't program an app that functions properly. Google assistant does not work when the phone is locked. I enabled the option in the settings for the assistant to give personal data when locked, but it didn't work. The routines in the Google Assistant didn't work either. The rest of the commands worked fine.

Performance (3/5):
The phone is fast, I didn't challenge it much except with compressing some videos. It is fast, and weirdly enough, it compresses videos to smaller sizes than on my OP8. It does heat up a little while compressing but that seemed normal to me. However, I noticed that it heats up a lot more with normal use (taking a short video, sharing it, chatting a little bit, YouTube) than my OP8.

Build (4/5):
The phones looks amazing to me (highly subjective) and feels premium. However, the display seems hollow to me when I tap on it with my finger nails, comparing it to a Samsung A31, Note 5 and the OP8. I bought the white color ‚Äì Google (and pretty much all companies) feels like they need to call it some weird name cloudy starlight or whatever ‚Äì and it looked quite good. I hated the shiny aluminum frame, it looked like the shiny plastic frames you find on the A series from Samsung. The speakers are not good at all, but I am used to the OP8, which has one of the best speakers out there. I can't exactly describe how it sounds, but it sounds like when you turn on the ""surrounding"" setting for your headphones.

Fingerprint reader (3/5):
It is fast enough when it actually tries to read your fingerprint. What does that mean? There were many cases where I lift the phone, it lights up and shows the fingerprint reader, I place my finger there and nothing happens. I lift my finger and retry, and it reads it perfectly, never missing. I guess the phone would wait for the animation to finish playing before attempting to read my fingerprint.",6 Pro >> 6A,"I just got my 6a too about a month ago. 

The camera is as good as everyone say!

Currently using it in Malaysia, dual sim set up, eSim as T-Mobile US(Wi-Fi calling/texting), and physical as local sim for call/data. (5G off, LTE only)

Cellular do drop from time to time out of the blue(exclamation mark), not sure if anyone else is having the problem with dual sim set up.

Battery do suffer with dual sim standby, heat up quite fast outdoor(average 31 C, 88 F), but still able to get it through the day. 

I have tempered glass screen protector since day 1, fp scanner is doing lot better here in Malaysia with humid weather, compare to in SF(dry chapped thumb). But still can't compare with my other budget phone like Motorola Edge 2022, also have in display fp scanner with glass protector. 

6A's fp scanner is very picky, has to press it the exact same direction/pressure like the way during set up to unlock it. I set it up many times over and over again, and settle with the one that I set up in a dark room, with wet finger, but still very tricky sometimes.

Overall it's pretty good, hopefully Google will fix the cellular connection issue in the near future...","Your English is great!

And glad you're also enjoying your 6a. It's an amazing device!","Do you miss oneUI features from Samsung like:

* better split screen / multitasking
* Samsung pass to remember passwords

My kids are due for an upgrade from their 4a which is an awesome phone but may hold off for the 7a but if the 6a drops even more then the current low price here in the states then it's a no brainier. Enjoy your Pixel!","I'm fine with 60 Hz, but my general experience with the 6a has been terrible.  
Besides the awful fingerprint scanner, I have been getting constant ""System UI isn't responding"" messages super often, camera app freezes the phone/won't work, or even restart my phone. It's almost not usable at some point, and I feel like throwing it against the wall.",I bought the Google pixel 6a a few days ago and I am very satisfied with the purchase since I have managed to take incredible photos and the fluidity is good despite the 60hz,"Just in case anyone else here is curious about this phone which btw was featured in a couple of tech gadgets review as one of the top budget options for android smartphones, There‚Äôs a price difference for sets from US and elsewhere. Apparently this is due to the camera sound issue which cannot be turn off if it is a non-US set. So unless you are using this phone for stealth mission this is actually alright for most folks out there.","I have used pixel 6a for a month now, and this is my first experience with a mid-ranged phone for over 30k. i am very satisfied with it, very honestly. It gives a super smooth interface to work on, and it has a super amazing camera. Thank god i bought the phone, my five year plan is sorted haha.","The english is great, don't worry about it. i am glad that you have liked the phone, I have been using the phone for a long time now and I am massively happy with the set. The best thing about the phone is the size of the phone.","If you are a fan of the pixel experience and want the best camera in this price range (below 30k) go for it.

Pros : Camera , Software Experience, Haptics (excellent; like some flagship device), stereo speakers (again best in this range) , and the pixel features like voice recording, magic eraser etc.

Cons : Heating while using mobile data , 60hz(for some people), not for gaming

Otherwise the moto edge 40 along with the nothing phone 1 seem to be the best under 30k for user experience and good(not as excellent as the pixel but good enough) cameras. These devices can also handle gaming better than the pixel (though they are not gaming phones look for iqoo or something if u are a gamer)

&#x200B;

Also yeah the 7A will never come under 30K even with BBD discount","The Pixel 6a is a really good phone and I can‚Äôt really think of anything better in the price range. The heating issue is a little overblown in my opinion. After extensive use it may get warm, but never to the point (in my usage anyway) where performance degrades or it becomes uncomfortable to hold. That being said, I‚Äôm in Pennsylvania, USA and don‚Äôt know that your experience would be the same in a hot summer in India. Hopefully someone on this sub has a 6a in India and can help with that specific aspect.","My honest view: Pixel 6A is a great daily use phone. 
It heats up normally while charging, you feel the warmth on the aluminium frame and nowhere else. That much heat is expected out of any smartphone these days. 
I am not a mobile gamer, so I don't play games and battery last up a full day for me. 
Camera shot photos are really great but videos shot are worse than my previous iPhone SE 2016 which I am still using. 
OLED panel is good and I love to zoom in and fill the screen with any video content. 
Speakers are great at max volume or above 90%, below that and they kind of sound mute. Used Wireless and USB C headphones and output is great for both.
There were some problems with fingerprint sensor not sensing finger at all which after getting the June Beta Update is resolved to a great extent. I removed Glass screen protector and replaced it with plastic film protector which helped further resolve the issue.
Clean UI helps in getting a fairly smooth experience.","Had a 4a that I sold off due to terrible battery performance after 2 years. Then bought a Nothing Phone 1 (it was either the 6a or this) in January for 27k as I prefer stock Android. Great phone all round except really bad shutter lag on the rear camera which ruined any photo which did not have completely still objects.

Now a week ago I sold off the Phone 1 for 20k and finally bought the Pixel 6a for 27K. And I finally feel at home. Slightly worse battery life than Phone 1 and runs a bit warm, but the whole experience is just on a different level. 

At the 27k price point, you get the best camera performance, best haptics (iPhone level), super optimised UI that makes the screen refresh rate feel more like 75hz than 60hz and the countless pixel exclusive features that really make life easier. 

In short, go for it. No other phone under 35k comes closes.","Had it for a few months, never had any heat issues at all (not a gamer though). Camera is great, took some awesome astrophotography pics with a tripod setup. Happy with mine.","Bah blah blah.  I live in Phoenix Arizona.  Temperatures are 100+.  I have never had my 6a overheated.  Don't listen to the  ""analysts '.  I've owed pixel phones from their introduction.  Still the best!","I had bought 6A for my wife. Initially, it had issues with heating and fingerprint reader. The heating issue got slowly sorted out, but took about 2 months to settle. A few others had no issues right from the get go. It may heat up a bit if you shoot 4k video, but that can happen to other phones as well. Although it was not heating up too much, every now and then it'd be a bit uncomfortable. I was anxious whether I had received a defective piece but it seems to have settled now ü§û. The fingerprint reader too had issues - after I applied a screen protector, it became an issue (I used Spigen one so I doubt it's because of that). Tried setting it up multiple times, and it'd work for a few times then it'd stop. After 2-3 months, the left hand thumb seems to be working 8 out of 10 times (the same thumb was added 3 times). No luck with the other hand. I knew these issues could be there but still went for it because of the stock OS, long term os support, good camera and performance. The only other phone I thought about was Samsung 21FE, which was costlier at the time. No other brand could convince me of long term performance. Would've gone for OnePlus but now they have become a generic Chinese company. I think Google changed their third party support partner recently and had seen 1 or 2 posts about the new one being a great improvement. If you are ready to face these issues, which most likely would be resolved over time, this can be a great option. If you want a hassle free experience out of the box, go for Samsung FE. I'm not sure about the long-term performance of Moto but I've heard some good things about the OS.",im from india and i recently got pixel 6a.the only issue i faced is when u use camera for longer periods like >20 mins .it starts heating.for normal use its more than enough,"Yeah, I just bought it too so my opinion might be a bit moot here but I LOVE IT. the case is coming later today, the battery backup is great (even when playing games) I can easily play honkai star rail, one of the most demanding games on the play store right now, on medium graphics very smoothly. The fingerprint sensor people complain about is easily fixed by registering the same finger 2 times, the camera is ecstatic, along with the AI features. And I dunno why since I put my sim in this phone I have not received a single spam call, my previous phone (iphoneXS) had me getting spam calls every hour. I really am an instant fan. And the phone will only get hot on the initial setup, cuz it's starting up and setting up everything for you. I say go for it. It even has water resistance, nothing phone lacks that.

I'm using it.,[deleted],"If you are ok with half a day of battery life and a portable heater, that's the phone for you. Worst phone I ever got. The only positive is the camera which is good but not better than my previous pixel 4a. The 6a is unreliable.

It's annoying when the modem stops working tho. Airplane mode off/on fixes it, but I have to notice first -.-

And VERY annoying is the fingerprint sensor. It's hit or miss. I miss the rear one.","You might have to double think if you really have a thought of getting 6a. 

Reason to not buy 6a -

1. Heating - The phone will run hot. Period. There's no fix for that. You game for a bit, it runs hot. Take 10-20 pictures, it runs hot. Experience 5g, it runs hot. Speak to someone on the phone, it runs hot. Charge the device, it runs hot. Use a case, it runs hot. No matter what you do. It'll definitely run hot. You'll always feel the heat of the phone while using it. 


2. Front camera - Definitely not at all worthy, when it comes to front-facing camera. For 30k you can get a good front-facing camera. But this one is below average. 


3. 5G - You can use 5g only if you can bear heating. You need to turn off 5g to get good SOT and to stop your device from over heating. What's the point of paying 30k and turning off the feature that you paid for. 


4. Charging - Believe me charging time will kill you. It'll take around 1.50 - 2 hrs to completely charge. It'll be a huge deal breaker for you. I've come from a REDMI device. My old phone supported 33W. It charges within 50mins around. But this one will definitely test your patience with 18w charging. 


5. Tensor chip - For 30k you should be allowed to game. Paying 30k and you will be allowed only to surf and click pictures. It's a big nah for me. Yes, there are better gaming phones out there. But for 30k Google should support your phone to play games without heating, right? My old device ran CODM smoothly. But this one stutters like a flagship phone from 10 years ago. 


Conclusion -


There are definitely better options out there. I've seen my friends using Nothing phone and Moto Edge 40. Do have a look at these phones for better options. Nothing phone 2 is going to launch within August. Have a look at it. I know you want to keep your device for 3+ years. But think practically, already it's been a year since the pixel 6a launcher. They promised 3 os updated. And already they rolled out A14 beta. In August they'll launch A14 stable. And another year, you'll get A15. That's it. You'll feel like having an old phone within a small amount of time. There are many Cons for P6A. So better opt out. Moto and Nothing phones can be considered at this price point. Edge 40 is really a game changing device compared to nothing phone.","Heating is fine for me.

The only annoyance is call dropping randomly and less than 50% accurate finger scanning with screen cover","4G doesn't heat up the phone much, but direct sunlight does. Using a camera in broad daylight will also heat up your phone pretty good. 5G gets the phone warm too.
Intense gaming again heats up the phone pretty bad.
The only drawback to the powerful processor is incompetent thermal solutions
If you get a phone cooler or something (impractical ik), it should work like a charm
Overall Pixel provides a pretty premium package and feel that nothing or Motorola can't match","Why do you think that 7a won't come under 30k?
even 6a release price is the same as the 7a release price & it went on sale for below 30k","Bought it 2 weeks ago, the heating issue only stayed for the 1st week apart from that everything is great as of now.","concerning the Pixel 6a :

The fingerprint reader is a piece of shit.

I really tried everything to make it work.

I spent hours re-registering my fingerprints and installing betas. getting my finger wet, testing different screen reactivity modes. testing different protections or removing them etc...

But nothing worked. It's just pure crap.

Unlocking your phone with this fingerprint reader is just a pain in the ass. It only works one time out of 10. And even when it does work, it takes a long time compared with all the fingerprint readers I've had before on other phones.

Pure crap.",You'll wanna get Flagship experience in mid range.This will be the 1st choice. Take one note: if you are a heavy user like 8-10 hrs screen time per day. It will definitely be drained by evening. I follow the 18hr charging schedule daily(like alternative days I'm gonna need it to charge twice). I think many users are on the same schedule.,"The phone only gets heated up when you're recording 4K video in 60fps. 

Other than this, I never noticed any heating issue.",My wife has had this phone for 4 months. I have the six pro and the 6A blows away my phone as far as speed highly recommended,"Bhai bindas lele me 1 month se use kar raha hu mast phone ha halka garam hota ha par abbee barish ka Mausam aa hi Gaya ha to koi problem nahi hogi gaming bee theek thak hoti ha me genshin 1, 1.30 hr tak aache se khel leta hu.

   I have a 4a and am wondering if this is a great deal. Total about $170
    I am not sure if i can afford 7.
What do u all think, except for heating issue?","Getting a good pixel 6a is sheer luck. But this is the case in most Brands....I bet you won't get such an awesome camera, ultra smooth vanilla Android and good battery back up for a day in 30k....I am even satisfied when I bought it a year back for 40k.... I would suggest if you want to squeeze the budget more then wait till launch of pixel 8 by that time pixel 6a would have reached 26k.....For the people who say that they have heating issues I would say their upgrades are not done properly, excessive app installs having unnecessary permission grants, excessive gaming and constant on mobile data.
Please be sure this is not a gamer phone....Only issues which I have found are related to Autoredial and Hangup which happen in the case of JIO Sim only for which I am tired following up Google for resolution.... Hopefully Android 14 resolves all software glitches","How is the future proofing, say with the 6gb of ram. While obviously being an older model, would 6gb of ram be enough min. 2 years from now?","The heating issue is also seen on iphone's as well, especially when using youtube with mobile data and you're moving in a car, using google maps in a car on mobile data, etc. Why? Because of the climate of India and the fact these phones do not have active cooling. Pixel 6a used to have heating on android 12, but with android 13 its largely fixed.

Otherwise for 25k to 27k you get a phone whose CPU is between a sd870 and sd888, the SOC's phones at this price have. You get stock android thats not bloated and will not slow down in the future. You get the best camera's in this price point. So you clearly win in software, SOC and cameras. 

Now, battery life errs more on the average side. And the slow 18w charging does not help matters. You might view the 60hz as a downside, but I and several others don't since it leads to better battery life. The 6.1' display size might be a bit small for some but it does allow 1 hand use more often. 

The under display fingerprint scanner works quite well with the latest updates. Its as reliable as side or rear mounted fingerprint scanners. 

Overall for 20-30k the pixel 6a is really good. I used to dislike the pixels since they provided underpowered CPU's and were overpriced. Not this time. Google gives you a flagship SOC which will help it age well. Easily should last 5-6 years. Since google's pixels are relatively easy to root and install custom roms on, you can easily slap in a new battery and use a custom rom to further extend the phone's lifespan.",I jst got one brand new from Mumbai India and its lovely no heating problem when in sunlight just increase the brightness and boy it's batt is awesome on Android 13 and now on 14 I believe its going to be better than ever. Go for it tiger.,"I'm in a love hate relationship with my Google Pixel 6a.

Fingerprint sensor sucks zombie balls. I have registered both my thumbs twice (only allowed 4 fingers) and I don't use a screen protector of any kind. Yet I can't unlock my phone in one try ever!! Every time I unlock my phone I feel like I'm arguing with my phone!! After 6 tries I end up using the pin... My blood boils every time I have to unlock my phone!! (I know about the moisture trick and it works but I really shouldn't have to lick my finger every time I want to unlock my weirdo phone)

Battery life is so bad I have to plan my trips around charging points!! (I like to travel alone and usually to remote locations. Also I come from Redmi k20 pro which had exceptional battery life. And yes I carry a power bank with me and I hate my phone for making me carry one.) A phone should work for atleast 11 hrs before needing charging!! If I keep maps on (for even 2 hrs) for a journey you can be sure that my phone won't make that trip without a power bank...

But the phone itself is amazing and I love the photos and videos I get from it (over heats when I use cinematic mode which is often) and the the overall software experience is gold. I get a lot of compliments about how nice it looks (Sage Green.) All the complementors face palm when I lick my finger to unlock my phone...

I've never had such unique problems with any phone before. I'm experiencing new emotions everyday.","Until the phone dies. I had my pixel 2 for 4 years. As long as it makes phone calls, texts, and can do Google searches quickly, that's all I need as a college student.","Love the 6a, 0 issues so far. 7a seems like a marginal upgrade so I'm skipping out on that and will probably wait to see how the 8 and 8 Pro will turn out ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but generally I don't have the need to upgrade the phone right now.",I'm holding out until the phone dies.  It does what I need and I'm happy with it.,I always said if it ain't broken no need to replace it. I'm not one of those people who needs to upgrade their phone every year. I had upgraded last year from a Pixel 4 to the 6a because I had to go on a trip to India. I'll tell you that my 6a took out some stunning photos during that trip and I only had to pay $300 for this phone. So let's just say I'm in no rush to replace this bad boy.,"I've been using the pixel 4a for a solid 3 years and have zero issues.  Battery still holds up surprisingly well, I may upgrade to a 6a but I'm waiting to see reviews of the 7a first.",A good trade-in deal.

I hope it can last me a couple of years. I'd love to upgrade to a pro version, just to have that telephoto lens. But the huge screen of the pro lineup really sets me off. If what you're saying is true, I'd be interested in the Pixel 9 Pro if they indeed go for a smaller size.","I'm holding onto my 5a until either it dies or they release a phone that I just have to have. I got this phone when it released, so it'll be 2 years this September, I think. I'd rate my experience with it A+, 10/10. I could not be happier if I tried.","I'm holding out for a good deal / trade in.  I got the 6a and a series buds by trading in my 3a, and paying $150.

I then bought a pristine 3a on ebay for $55, and copy my pictures to it every night through folder sync, and have it upload them to google pictures, to keep the unlimited cloud storage.","I think the Pixel 6a is a very solid complete device. 

It's not missing anything noteworthy that makes it incomplete. The cameras are tried and tested. The screen gets bright enough in sunlight, the battery life is pretty good and the Tensor chip is a decent performer. 

Would wireless charging be nice? Sure
Would a high refresh rate screen be nice? Sure 
Would some extra storage options be nice? Sure 

There are certainly things Google could provide to make the device nicer, but they are not required. The Pixel 6a for $299 is just tremendous value and I think it will last for 3-4 years no problem if you want to keep it that long.

For me personally, I'll probably pick up the Pixel 8a when it launches or a sale price Pixel 8 about 7 months after its launch. Not because I'm holding out for anything, but opening a brand new device is quite exciting.",S22,I will see what the 8 brings but otherwise I'm good with it at the moment.

So far nothing much, it gets a little warm but i've never had any bugs, crashes or anything. 

I'd ideally like to keep it at least two years and see what's up with the Pixel 9 or 10. 

I'd LOVE if the pixel had a dex like feature so I can use it as a DIY laptop, but it will never happen while they Google are still making chromebooks.","I'm not really holding out for anything. I'll probably just keep it until either the phone dies or it stops getting updates.

By ""exception deal"", I mean like the Black Friday 6a deal last year, when there was a steep discount + exceptional trade in values (could buy used IPhone7 for $70 and trade in for $250) + $130 capital one rewards + $1100 store credit.

Phone took a direct hit on the edge of the screen, right at where the glass starts to curve - no amount of screen protector can save this. Phone still works fine after that, but it was the end for me. Instead of lamenting my luck, somehow I was glad that I have a solid excuse to find another phone.

The power inside the Zenfone 10 is incredible for the size and I almost just want to get it now but the 2 year OS updates turned me off completely when Pixel 6 pro/6 base have them until 2025 and Security until 27.

Lost me right there. This garbage is repeated in every phone review for the past 10 years. It has lost all meaning. It seems to just mean glass back, which is not premium at all. This phone has a gross glossy back that is full of fingerprints and slippery AF. It's the worst part of the phone imo.","I got my Pixel 6A two days ago, coming from a Moto G6 running android 9!

Quite a significant jump for me. 

Some quick notes:

* I am trying the gesture navigation, but the multi-tasking and swiping left or right to go back is a bit annoying. Especially coming from the traditional three button nav.
* I am trying the gesture navigation, but the multi-tasking and swiping left or right to go back is a bit annoying. Especially coming from the traditional three button nav. Extra annoying when using an app with the ham burger menu as I am used to swiping left to open it, now the phone will just go back a page.
* The phone feels premium. It's a bit heavier and taller than my previous phone so that will take some time.
* The fingerprint is super hit or miss. I had to scan my right thumb three times and redo it about the same. It misreads my thumb 8/10 times.
* Had no issues so far with the signal, although I haven't been outside with it yet.
* Battery seems good. I have charged it once so far which is good after heavy use setting the device up.

Overall I am happy but it's very early days. I was going to get another cheap phone, but we have some crazy Pixel deals here in the UK right now so I had to bite. I was torn between the 6 and 6A, 6 for the extra ram and 90HZ screen but the 6A has approximately 1 year of extra software support.","I'll raise you a few as someone who traded in his Pixel 6A and ""downgraded"" to a Samsung Galaxy A33. I had my 6A for over 2 months after yet again ""downgrading"" from a Xiaomi 12. The Pixel 6A is honestly.. and I am ashamed to say.. a *slightly* overrated phone.

Everything about the phone is a coin flip except the build quality and design. Tensor gave it a lot of mileage and performance to compete but the measly 6GB RAM is lackluster in 2022 (atleast for an Android). The battery just won't hold up longer than a lot of its budget competition and the cameras are inconsistent albeit very good under ideal conditions.

The phone felt amazing to use, yes but I keep getting the feeling that Google continually took too many unnecessary compromises with the 6A. The lack of wireless charging is odd, the basic setup of camera lenses doesn't help itself in some situations, the 60Hz display is just ""ok"" and the phone warms up too often despite updates and resets during my experience. And then Google keeps dropping news such as new Pixel features not dropping for the 6A. It just feels bad.

And the Pixel 6A... is overpriced anywhere else besides the US. Atleast where I am. I enjoyed my 6A a lot but I just couldn't stand the warming ups, bad battery life and inconsistent camera shots (I do a lot of mobile/product photography for social media for work). And surprise surprise... when I traded it in for the Galaxy A33 mainly for better battery life... it actually works almost as well if not better than the 6A.

The A33 doesn't shoot punchy yet natural colorful photos but the portrait mode was far more consistent and very solid. Magic Eraser is an overrated gimmick that I only just found out even Samsung's gallery editor can do. 6GB vs the A33's 8GB RAM was noticeable (obviously). And the battery life is not even close between the two. Plus the 90Hz display looks better in many of my use cases. That's it. For far more less money.

The performance I get now does take a hit. Ultrawide is very meh. And videography is even worse (but the 6A doesn't do it any better). Charging speed is barely different anyways.

What I'm saying is again, the Pixel 6A is in my opinion overrated. I want to like it more beyond the novelty of premium pure Android on a budget. But if anyone is considering it, please check out any of the other budget phones first. Because to be honest, the Pixel 6A has a lot of killer budget competions.

If I were to rate the 6A, its a 7/10 at best.

The A33 I would give a 7.5/10.","Google goes extras mile disabling 5G in markets where phone isn't officially sold (TLDR in most of the world) although it could work perfectly fine, which can be proven with rooting.

It's the main reason I don't consider this phone together with big width.",Does anyone knows the touch sampling rate for the 6A?,"I love mine but the 2 hours charging time is the big issue I have with it

Lots of ""bloat"" on a device is often only seen on carrier or reseller specific phones (e.g., Verizon or Amazon), that have installed them into the system image (so called ""ROM"").

After one week, I decided to flash GrapheneOS. But the screen bothers me too much, it's very poor quality and the viewing angle is so bad, it's one of the worst screen interactions I experienced.

Yes, the camera is a little better for pictures but the video was still better on my samsung S20fe ( snapdragon). And obviously bad selfie camera on 6a.

I'm probably going to get hate but that's my experience.","My girlfriend was pretty happy with her 6a besides the fingerprint sensor (which is weird because my 6 Pro worked every time).Though I just helped her upgrade to a Pixel 8 because Best Buy was offering $300, and she's been saying she loves her fingerprint sensor now lol. Her SoT was around 10 hours regularly, but honestly the main thing she's been happy about since upgrading is the macro mode of all things lol.","I bought a 6a used ""like new"" for my son. I was pretty impressed with it tbh after having had issues myself with both the pixel 6 and pixel 7.

The battery life is not amazing but usually with his usage he'll easily get a day out of it and the fingerprint is just 'ok' it works more than it doesn't though and tbf for him at least it works much better than his previous Motorola phone with a rear fps.

I do find it quite odd the inconsistency of people's experiences with pixel devices.","Had the 6a, coming from the iPhone 11 Pro. Was happy with my Pixel 6a, eventhough there was a time when the Fingerprint reader was total ass. In the past months everything has been good again though. I am happy that with Android 14 they included auto unlock if your PIN has six digits. 

The battery isnt good. Gets me through the day but I don't take a lot of images. I have the Pixel 7 now which I bought for less money than my 6a this January and while it is the better phone, it isnt that much better than the 6a tbh. If you want good battery, Pixels are a let down unfortunately. You won't get battery monsters.","I got a 6a and I just tried unlocking it 10 times in a row, and it didn't fail once, your fingerprint reader must be faulty.

As far as battery life I do may be 1h of screen time and 1h of podcast per day I'm a really light user, it easily last me 2 days wich is not great but not bad either. On the rare occassion of prolonged heavy use I bring an external battery with me.

I got it to overheat a couple times filming for 10+ minutes under the sun on a hot day, it's pretty frustrating if you buy that phone for that kind of use but on lighter use no issue.

I'm still happy with the phone because for 300‚Ç¨ it makes great photos and it's a decent phone for most users.

edit : and I should add reading some comments I don't like 5g so I'm always on LTE mode","I got the finger print reader working well on my 6a. I think moving your finger about during the process matters. Look at which bit of the finger it's asking you to scan when programming it. If that doesn't work try only using one bit of the finger. The bit you'll likely use each time. It didn't like it after I'd been gardening and had mucky/dry hands but otherwise no problem. The battery on android 13 was meh but on 14 is a lot better. Accubattery is saying I can use screen for 11 hours in a row or leave it on standby for 45 hours. On average combined use of 27 hours. Heating was a big problem in android 13. In android 14 it's less noticeable but does happen in camera especially video and web browsing. Signal quality was good. Slightly better than my previous galaxy in fact. In the end though I've just upgraded to a 7a. My previous a52s had 120hz and 60hz just wasn't smooth enough when I'm used to that. The camera too processed images well but you could see the noise in poor light. So I'm now using the 7a. So far the smoother refresh rate is lovely. The camera is quite a lot better inside with much less noise in shadow areas, warmer colours and a less processed look. That new sensor is a decent improvement. Also better outside for nightscapes. And I had wind and clouds when I tested the 7a so in similar conditions to when I used the 6a it should comfortably outclass it. Slightly worryingly the signal strength seems to be lower than the 6a. Hoping that's just due to the network as it does fluctuate a bit here. But I was getting -97 on that and I'm currently on -108 on my 7a in the same room. Only time will tell.","On the P7 I've registered my thumbs and index fingers and after a day or so, ONLY my left thumb will work... sometimes. I've stopped trying to reregister because it forces some apps to go through a whole process of registering for biometric logins again. The face scanner is one of the main reasons I want to get a P8.","Wait, zombie balls?","I've never had battery issues with my Pixel 6a. However I've noticed that some apps can really chew up battery if they're not closed. I'm looking at you, TuneIn!",Same here with the 6 Pro man,I love my P6A especially on Android 14. My only two complaints are that the screen could be brighter (I travel a lot so need maps on during the day for navigation) and I am noticing a drop in the quality of photos.,"I don't face the issue with my 7P fingerprint sensor. Just wondering if you followed the instructions to register the fingerprint.

It will instruct you to scan for the left side, right side, tip, middle a few times.",Wait until your USB port dies. Mine is on life support.,"I had this issue when I bought my pixel 6 (not 6a) . For some reason it improved . Now it's much better . Works 10 out of 10 . But it is slower than other fingerprint phones .
I hope it will get better for you with time.","Same here.
1. Fingerprint scanner works 7 out of 10 times indoors, and almost never under direct Sunlight. Coming from an iPhone 11, I definitely miss the FaceID due to this fingerprint scanner.
2. Screen visibility is utterly poor, again under direct Sunlight, but I've seen much cheaper Redmi phones doing way better at this.
3. Camera is very disappointing. I used Pixel 3A a few years ago, which produced better pictures even with the same hardware. I feel that the 'need' to keep the images 'natural' is being taken too far by the software, and the result is lifeless pictures devoid of the actual colors. This forces me to use Lightroom app whenever I want to capture a beautiful moment.
4. Battery life is decent, but when Google Maps is on, my 15 year old Civic feels more fuel efficient than this phone.
5. Sucks that spatial audio (for PBP) is not available on the A series phones. I don't know how that sounds because I can't experience it till I upgrade to the 6, 7, 8 or the Pros. But I can say that on P6A, sound is more engaging and fuller on the realme Buds Wireless 2 neckband. Result, I use the PBP only when I need more noise cancellation or if the neckband runs out of battery when I'm in the middle of listening to something.

If I were to upgrade to another Pixel, should I go for P6P (if it comes back in stock) or P7? P7P, P8, and P8P are out of my budget at the moment, due to their ludicrous pricing in India.",I echo your sentiments for the 6a. Fingerprints are inconsistent and battery life is kinda subpar. Came from a Samsung mid ranger because I loved the Google UI and how smart it is despite the drawbacks. Just upgraded to a P8 and have been loving it so far (except the shoddy battery life at times...) I finally realised that there is a difference between flagships and budget alternatives indeed!,"6a user here, I unlock with my finger 99/100 times at first try.

Battery is best from all phones I had, I have plenty left (30-50%) at the end of the day while using it pretty frequently (Not using 5G)","Looks like despite the figures the 7a is better for reception than both the 6a and previous galaxy as I can get 60 mbs on 5g and 48 on 4g in a basement canteen where the 6a only managed about 8! The 7a is also noticeably quicker in 90hz mode and feels lightening fast, near instantaneous. 6a was quick but 7a is quicker. Early impressions suggest a much larger difference between these 2 than the reviews stated. The camera is definitely better in low light and by quite a bit as well. Not quite as good as a 1 inch sensor compact but closer to that than a standard compact camera or other previous phone.","Just pick up the 8. This is the best phone they've ever put out. I had the six, I was really excited about it but realized that I had a better experience with the 4a. I traded the 6 in for the 7. I felt like they were close to nailing it, but frankly it still seemed like too much phone in my pocket. The pixel 8 in my opinion is the absolute perfect Android phone. üëçüèº",6a needs to be put on 4g only for decent battery life. If it keeps looking for 5g signals it kills battery a lot quicker.,"My relationship with my 6a was ALL hate. The evil, spiteful kind of hate. 

The 6a was so bad that my move to the similarly maligned Pixel 7a felt like it was an incredible smartphone upgrade. 

If you truly care about your health and well being, ditch that 6a as quickly as you can. No one should have to endure that much difficulty in life.","Agreed the fingerprint sensor is awful, a tip I got was to use an index finger instead, and since then it's been pretty flawless, so I use my left thumb, and right index to unlock, and it's been much better 

My battery life is solid, so I don't have that issue 

But yeah this piece of shit phone and I are at war lool

Can't wait until next April","I have the 6a and while I'm very fine with the fingerprint sensor, the mid autonomy + 2h charging is driving me mad as well. My phone is constantly wired and charging all day which is pathetic. My love for the software experience is the only thing blocking me from swapping brands","The 6a pushed me towards Samsung and I haven't used a samsung phone since the galaxy nexus! Love Pixel camera, feel its the best in simple point and shoot, but the overheating and awful battery even when nerfed to Lte made me switch. I'll stay away from Pixels until I know their hardware improves.","I have a 6a and recently upgraded to the 8. Battery life was around 11 hours prior to Android 14, drastic improvement post-update. I haven't had many issues with the finger print scanner. It's definitely not the best but it works. The WORST thing about this phone is the location of the NFC chip which is in the bottom half. Makes mobile payments very annoying.",Are your referring to the cinematic pan when you say cinematic mode?,The 6a sucks ass. I moved to iPhone during the 6 generation. I purchased a p8p and while it's world better my iPhone Is still in the drawer calling my name from time to time.,"Same here except my fp scanner works pretty good now, ever since March or so but the battery life sucks ass. It would lose 20% in an hour or two just by sitting in my pocket while connected to the mobile network (4g btw, don't have a 5g plan). What's funny now is that since I firmly decided to buy an S23 my battery life suddenly improved, it still drains in stand by on the mobile network but noticeably less than before. Maybe A14 helped.",I upgraded from 6a to the 8pro and I'm glad I did. My 6a would constantly overheat and the battery life was horrible.,Turn off the 5G. My battery life since A14 has been bonkers.,">Battery life is so bad I have to plan my trips around charging points!!

If you don't have 5G coverage in your area or don't have a 5G plan, force it to use LTE, saves a ton of battery by forcing it on LTE/3G. Battery life has been very good on A14, especially idling (it doesn't drop much these days).",I have a 7Pro and the 6a. I have no problem recommending the 6a to anyone at all. Almost as snappy and still takes great photos. Overall it's been a solid phone for me,Here is my upvote. Agree on all points. I upgraded from a Pixel 4a and have no issues with my 6a.,"You'll never manage to please everyone no matter what. Facts are facts though, for the price Google are selling the 6a when on sale. It is an absolute steal price to performance wise. One person might have horrible battery, another might have excellent battery. It's the same every cycle whenever a new phone is launched",My only real complaint about my 6a is that the fingerprint scanner fucking sucks.,"The screen is a little dim but I would recommend the 6a too, especially at the current sale price.","My 6a has been an awesome phone for the value, and that's the best way to sum it up. Battery has been fine, nothing to complain about. Software and the addition of the Tensor chip has made the user experience pretty seamless and smooth. Camera has been near flagship quality for still shots, unless you need to zoom, then drops off gradually. Plenty of software support and nifty tricks google offers in stock android. Compare it to the phones just $100 cheaper or even the same price range and it's night and day being the clear winner, but start comparing it to flagships then you run into some differences.",I don't think opinions are actually as split as it seems. People are just more likely to express their criticisms on Reddit or other forums instead of randomly posting about how happy they are with their device.,The fingerprint is the most terrible one I have tried. I have to open my mouth and breathe on my thumb to make it work.,"1. Negative minority is always the most vocal one.

2. Connection issues happen mostly in US.

3. People are idiots.


You've got mfs out there with pointless screen protectors complaining that their FPR doesn't work...","Google had very bad QC on the fingerprint sensors in the 6 and 7 series.  Some work fine and some are awful.  That's why you get such varying feedback.  The people that got a good one think that the people that got a bad one are lying or exaggerating.  The people that got a bad one think that the people that got a good one are full of crap.  My wife and I got P6P and we got bad ones.  No screen protector, we've both tried scanning our fingers multiple times in every condition imaginable.  They just don't work well at all.  Sometimes it works after a few seconds.  Other times it scans for 3 seconds, fails, 3 seconds, fails, 3 seconds, fails and then requires a pin.","My 6a is going through an RMA process. Fingerprint wasn‚Äôt working half the time, i kept being unable to  connect to LTE unless i would reboot the phone and on a couple of occasions, my 6a would just freeze. 

With the experience i'm having, i can't recommend that one, plus to make Google honor their warranty, after a month of making me wait without news, i had to pressure them by bringing the consummer protection bureau. Only then did they allow me to start an RMA to get a replacement unit.

Once i get that replacement, it's going. I'm not even opening it. Someone will buy it and i'll get another phone.",[deleted],[deleted],I have a 6a. I had a 6. It's a bit smaller but the sensors are much better than the 6. I've been very happy with it overall.,"I think a lot of ""reviewers"" didn't take their time with the phone. I experienced some heating issues the first three days, but after that it's not gotten hot. The fingerprint reader does suck. The screen is a bit dim. But for the money it's a hell of a bargain.","Some people are hung up on specs. 60 hz, no wireless charging either. It's a very solid phone and a fantastic value.","I have a Pixel 7, some people say it has a terrible battery, some say it has a bad fingerprint sensor too. But i never had a problem with the fingerprint scanner. The battery is ok. Buying a phone with exynos CPU you shouldn't expect much.
For pixel 6a battery life should be better with a small screen and 60hz display. Overheating is understandable because of the smaller body. 
Opinions are split because even my opinion is split. I was thinking about which one to buy for 2 months. In so many ways 6a was a better variant for me. I like small phones, I don't care about the 90hz or 120hz display. On my pixel 7 I switched to 60hz anyway. But still I preferred the pixel 7 because of one more year software update. And a more premium feel. And better design.","Some people can't fathom that a phone can be cheap, 60hz screen, old camera sensor, and no wireless charging can be good.

I chose 6a over 7 because it is a lot more sensible in this economy, it's really good",6a is a great phone for folks to jump right into Google's world!  Especially at these prices recently.,[deleted],"My 6a is okay overall.
 2 keys issue though, keeps dropping network connectivity...have to keep toggling airplane mode to get back mobile connectivity
Secondly my tap to wake and lift to wake have stopped working. Have tried some solutions like restarting in safemode and switching off bluetooth but still have a problem.","After using 6A for a few months, the only complaint that I have is it sucks to play Genshin Impact on this device. It lags for the most part when I do battles. Other than that very good battery life (6-7hours SoT, always on display off). Performance is very good for day to day tasks. Fingerprint is not as bad as people claim it to be. Oh the other annoying part is it has less cellular reception compared to other devices I used. But it never bothered me. I can gladly recommend this to anyone.","I love my pixel 6a. I even use it for Xbox cloud gaming, that's how good its performance is. People will always want more and pick at minute things.","Went from a 5a to the 6a. 6a battery is dogshit compared to the 5a (same apps and settings). SOT of 4 hours when new, the 5a was at 7-8. The fingerprint sensor sucks; the bright flash on the sensor is incredibly unsettling especially at night. I don't miss the 3.5mm jack as I was always on Bluetooth, though I do dislike losing the option.

On the positive side the camera is much better. I took a early morning light photo that was instantaneous on the 6a and would have been a couple seconds on the 5a.","My pixel 6a doesn't get hot and fingerprint sensor is excellent. 

60hz doesn't even bother me and never will on a phone. However.. I'm a heavy user and find the battery is the weakest link. Had to complain about something..","Can confirm on the phone overheat, but. Only for the first few days of using it, I was worried at first... My p6a is 3 months old now.. Sometimes it does get a lil bit warm but from playing games and using GPS... Otherwise. No problem at all.

The fingerprint thing, I don't have any problem while using silicone protector. But with tempered glass... Sometimes it doesn't detect even when the screen protector mode is on.

Not a deal breaker for me, overall it is the best phone I've used. I upgraded from P3XL BTW.",Yes the fingerprint sensor on the 6a is a disaster indeed.,"The newer pixels are really polarizing. I have been with google phones since the Nexus, and had so many issues (especially the fps) with the p6 and p7 I had to switch to another brand. Haven‚Äôt tried the 6a, but it seems to cause the same concerns.",[removed],"It's a mixed bag it seems, with people having some or no problems. I always buy the a series of Pixels and pride myself on not needing a flagship because I just need a reliable daily driver with no frills and for me Pixel has done that since the Pixel 1.

Pixel 6a was the first one that couldn't function as a daily driver for me. The fingerprint scanner on mine worked OK and then progressively got worse til it didn't work at all (yes I rescanned them using all of the tricks). Worse was that the modem would drop out constantly, whether I was on wifi or cellular. This all happened a week after I got the phone, so I was able to return it and get a P7P which, so far, works insanely well by comparison.

I would not recommend the Pixel6a because, while it was amazing when it worked (easily the most powerful a series phone), the quality control on them is subpar and it's not worth the risk of the phone suddenly not working a month in.","Reception is garbage on the 6a, which really stinks. The rest of the phone has been great",Because clowns think they can spy a difference between 60hz and 90hz. They also think they must have  flagship specs for $449.,"I have had zero problems with the fingerprint, at least reasonably. I don't expect the fingerprint scanner to work as soon as I get out of the shower, for example. 

Casual browsing and social media? Fine. Extended video playback? Games? A little heat and it can get uncomfortable tbh, but I've also just started taking it out of the case when it does this and heat goes down.

My biggest gripe with the phone is the battery. It's ass! I don't care what anybody says, I bought this phone new and right out of the box it became obvious that I'd need to charge the phone every night. I've never bought a brand new phone before that wasn't good for at least 2-3 days out of the box. I honestly shudder to think what my 6a's battery life is going to be in a year... This may be the first time I have to take a phone to a shop and get a fresh battery put in ü§Ø

Besides the battery, I really like the phone. It's a good size, feels snappy, great camera, I like the fingerprint scanner. I wish this phone would last me 2+ years but I don't know that it will... And that's probably why AT&T sold it to me for ~$120.",Because people think that what people say on the Internet equals what happens in real life,"Phone is trash tbh, only a grandma would settle for those specs",I've shared my experience on this very sub if you are interested,"If pixel 6a can have 90hz screen and fill up that camera hole on the face just like pixel 4, it will be the best choice for me.ü•π",Well I have a 4a. And I see not much improvement. I see downgrades in the 6a to be honest.,"I'm happy with mine. It cost me ¬£184(after trade in) and is a mammoth upgrade to my nexus 4 as a backup. 
Fingerprint has its issues from time to time but hasn't been too bad for me. 
For me, the phone I got for the price paid is unbelievable value.",Well the phone does get super warm. Actually burned my fingers lightly drawing abit on it. They were tanned for a day because of it.,"I own the 6a. Bought it for 330 and it s great! I had a redmi note 11 before, which I bought for a very low price and I would defenitely say the higher price is wearth it","Yeah this is a great phone for the price, but it is little small for me. I swiched from an s10+",I have the 4a which mysteriously started having tons of issues the moment the phone was 2 years out from the release date. I love the phone and the software experience but I'm concerned about getting another pixel because of this. I just want it to work it's used for my job and it's a huge pain in the ass when maps just stopped working correctly and hasn't since (one of many things),mines great,"I think it is because there are some bad batches of this phone. I also was having terrible connectivity issues with my brand new 6A. After over a month of trying to get an RMA, I finally got a refurbished 6A.
My advice would be to buy a 6A from a retailer that you can return it to if you have any issues with it. But do not use Google store or Google Fi. Their customer service is some of the worst I have ever experienced. Only posting about my issues on Reddit, and having their Reddit team light a fire under someone at Google Fi enabled me to have a phone that actually works.","Got my girlfriend a 6a and I use a 6 Pro. Only thing that stops me from recommending the 6a is the fact you can grab a 6 Pro used for about the same price. But if you want a brand new phone with warranty, the 6a is the way to go for a Pixel. However, I believe the 7a is gonna knock it out the park so it may be worth waiting for that if someone is gonna get a mid-ranged Pixel.","Some 6a's have fingerprint scanner issues and thermal issues.  Not all do.

Take my 6 pro for example--it never had an issue with the fingerprint scanner.  But lots of people had issues on theirs.

The 6a is generally very good value, so it is easy to recommend.","I just picked one up because my Z Flip 4 fucked up. Really solid phone, just don't like I don't have wireless charging or high refresh display. I love the size too.","I think it still suffers from a terrible modem and the original tensor can overheat pretty easily, but it's a cheap phone so I think it far exceeds its price point in value.","Simply because reddit has a giant amount of trolls.  
The pixel line has been so fucking great since the pixel 6","My issue is with the high idle drain. It's a good phone for the price that other countries are getting . Unfortunately the deals aren't too much exciting in my country.  

Also after using a pixel for the first time in 6a , I don't feel any magic with the Google software. The camera is amazing . But that's all. It's clean ui . Like a moto phone . Most of the useful features aren't supported in my region. So ....

All I would wish is for a snapdragon tsmc made chip instead of tensor. I could trade it for the pixel exclusivity tensor brings .","Went from iPhone 11 Pro to the 6a. I am happy to be using a Pixel again but I miss Face Unlock. Why in the name of fuck did Google have to run behind the competition with their in Display Fingerprint reader? It is not good. Why not stick to the working back side Fingerprint reader? Why not in the power button? Idk, anywhere but not the average in Display one. Give us face unlock again or whatever","It does get warm with 5G enabled because the modem is just bad. The fingerprint is just fine for the price point, but I've found it can't read my fingers shortly after I take a shower. I do wish the display was at least 90hz, since most mid-range phones are launching with that display. In my opinion, the 6a is the best Android phone you can buy because it has an excellent camera and runs 99% of apps quickly all without breaking your wallet.","6a is excellent. It gets warm on occasion, but ‚Äúoverheat‚Äù makes it sound like it‚Äôs a bigger problem than it is. I haven‚Äôt experienced any performance degradation when it gets warm or anything, so I don‚Äôt see what the fuss is about. 

The fingerprint reader isn‚Äôt as good as the Pixel Imprint of old, but I think that‚Äôs mostly because there‚Äôs no indentation to guide your finger so it‚Äôs easier to miss. You need to be somewhat more deliberate with this one. That said, unlocking my 6a is a mindless affair at this point because I know where my finger goes and it goes there easily. Failures occur for me less than once a day. Aside from those with hardware defects, this issue also seems overblown (or maybe I‚Äôm just lucky). 

Complaints about the modem are valid though. That‚Äôs the one thing that has me looking forward to the 7a. It‚Äôs not unusable or anything but once in a while will stumble in places with poor service (in comparison to my iPhone 12 mini at least). I also noticed when running speed tests on my home wifi against my iPhone that my 6a appears to have lower priority for some reason. You can assign priority manually in the router settings, but I verified that‚Äôs not the case so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on there.","It doesn't overheat in my experience, but the fingerprint sensor is utterly awful compared to anything else on the market.

It's still faster than the PIN numbers we all were using for ages though, assuming I reset it every month or so.",It's a great phone especially if you are in the US. We haven't had a phone with a flagship processor that's decently cheap (Especially now that it's $300) but anywhere else across the pond there's so much more variety in the midrange category the 6a kinda becomes a bad choice for others. (Especially as it isn't as available worldwide),"I upgraded from 3a and the only thing I don't like about it is the fingerprint reader. Not so much that it doesn't work well, but I prefer to have it on the back (or under the screen like my moto x4 did) It's hard enough to keep the screen clean without putting a finger on it all the time (or in my case a thumb). Plus the bright flash is hard to take at night. I Love the size, I hate giant phones!",60hz is a no for me that's about it.,"5a to 6a is probably not worth it (in hindsight, the 5a was a unicorn of a device that probably should have received even more praise than it got), but any other a-line, older main line devices, or for someone looking for a cheap entry to Google phones, I don't think there's too many objective reasons as to why it's not the best phone for the money. The fingerprint sensor *does* suck, the phone *does* overheat, and there *are* going to be one-off quality control issues, but none of these are to the point of being unacceptable IMO. You get what you pay for, and as a whole package, the 6a is the best midrange Android phone on the planet, no question.",Love my 6a and my fingerprint sensor does not seem to heat up at all but could be specific weather conditions causing it to heat up more and I recommend the 6a all the time,"Here's a newcomer's opinion on the 6a. Coming from the Xiaomi Mi 10T, I freaking love this phone. First of all, it is sooo refreshing to use a smaller phone compared to a behemoth that was the Xiaomi, the form factor is just perfect, and it's light, but not too light. Second, the OLED display is just great, sharp, bright and I don't mind the 60hz refresh rate because it's so well optimized with the software and it feels smooth. Third, I'm really surprised with the battery life, it last me a full day of real heavy usage and I go to bed, wake up and it is between 20 or 15% left. Fourth and for me most important, these cameras are the best I've ever used since the Huawei P10, maybe even better. The pics come out clean and sharp, night sight is awesome and the video stabilization is really great, the best I've used on an Android. My only gripe with this one is it's ""fast"" charging, which is slow for today's standards, but I'll get used to it and I can always let it charge overnight. All in all, for me, this is definitely the best phone you can buy for 350‚Ç¨.

Despite its flagship-level design and triple-camera system, the phone is just not performing well. The battery life is subpar, and the phone can get pretty hot, making it uncomfortable to hold. I was hoping that this would be a great budget-friendly option, but I'm not so sure anymore. I'm starting to regret my purchase and wish I had gone with a different phone.","I switched from Samsung A51 5G to 6a a month a go and it's been quite a bad experience.

1. Good back camera: The only con of my Mi Note 11. It has shitty camera. 
2. Clean UI. 
3.Google AI services like Magic Eraser.
4. Screen Quality: Contrast and color is much better on P6A

Cons:
1. No call recording: My Mi phone has automatic call recording.
2. No dual sim: Tried esim. It drains the battery like crazy on P6A. Mi Note 11 easily managed two Sims for entire day.
3. Horrible battery: My Mi Note 11 has 5000 mah battery that lasts 1.5 days. I need to charge P6A twice a day.
4. Slow charging: Takes forever to charge P6A. I charge my Mi phone on 30w charger in under an hour.
5. Camera Sound: I cannot turn off the camera sound on P6A. I can do that on Mi Note 11.
6. Finger Print scanner: The scanner is absolutely horrible. I need to scan my thumb 3-4 times to unlock my phone. My Mi Note 11 has fingerprint scanner in the power button itself.","The fingerprint sensor could definitely be better, but I haven't had any problems with overheating.

The room will thunder will applause.",I'm on a 4a and this doesn't look like a major upgrade from that apart from the battery. I like the 3.5mm headphone jack.,"Pretty much what I was expecting.

After seeing that high refresh rate I was never going back",Welp guess the 4a just needs to last forever,"Dang, I was hoping for 90Hz screen. Not necessarily a deal breaker, but if there's no 3.5 jack, then I'd hope for waterproofing to make up for it. I guess I'll see on the price then. I'm in desperate need to replace my 3a (serious overheating issues), and was hoping the 6a would be the replacement I was looking for. I was considering a P6, but given the connectivity issues that have come out, I don't think I could afford to spend that much for something so unreliable.

Worse specs in general than a 6 (obviously, but let me finish...), but a significantly smaller battery than a 5a, AND no headphone jack, AND no official waterproofing? 

Like who are they thinking is going to buy this? If you want the economy phone that does all the basics with none of the expensive, rarely used flagship features, the 5a is objectively better.

If you don't mind not having a headphone jack and want current gen tech, why would you buy this over a regular Pixel 6 given that they'll probably be within $50-100 of each other? 

And of course if you want the best of the best, this device isn't on your radar at all for any reason, lol.

Who exactly do they expect to buy this? What does the supposed consumer desire in a device that this phone absolutely nails?

Like unless Google can somehow launch this for like $300, there is absolutely no reason to buy this over other Google offerings. If it's starting at $400 like most in this thread seem to suspect it will be, I just don't see why on earth you would buy this over either a 5a or a 6 non-pro, depending on which side of that spectrum you value more.

EDIT: $449, apparently.","I knew the 60hz screen was likely, but damn did I hope for more. Especially because similar phones like the poco m4 pro have 90hz and similar specs in the 200$ range.

It's significantly improved the temps and battery life on my phone. Plus it's not like I saw a big difference in connectivity or speed,"Is the battery draining quickly? if not I would ignore the phone being warm as that just means it's getting rid of the heat efficiently.   


The rattle you hear is the optical stabilization mechanism, all phones that have it rattle when you shake them, turn on the camera app to test it, if you have the camera app opened it won't rattle.   


Charging takes this long because the pixel is preserving the battery health, you can charge from 20% to 75-80% in 30 minutes, beyond that percentage it's damaging to fast charge the battery, some people hate this feature, but I know my battery will be fresh even 3-4 years down the line.

YMMV.","I'm not too happy with my 6a either.  The fingerprint sensor is my top issue. I am running Android 13 and it's worse than 12 with unlocking.  I tried removing my registered finger prints and it's still flaky.  

I don't like the phone being constantly warm.  My 4a never had that issue.  Any excess heat like that will hurt the battery over time.  It's never cool to the touch and I don't have many apps on it. I reviewed the battery usage and nothing stands out.","I had regret about 1 minute after taking it out of the box....... I went from a pixel 4a to 6a and it's been a terrible experience. First impression was WTF I thought I checked the size.... why is this so much bigger than my 4a......   After getting it setup and everything transferred over, the new fingerprint reader turns out to be complete garbage. I could use by 4a back fingerprint reader to instantly unlock my phone, now I have to turn on the ""flip phone to turn on screen"" option, then hope that my fingerprint reader reads my fingerprint and if it does I get the double vibrate unlock time. It just feels like they released an untested reader because ""it looks high tech"" when in reality we moved back about 5 years in technology functionality. After having the phone for a couple weeks, my hand cramps a lot holding the bigger size and weight of the new phone, and battery life is about the same as what my 2 year old 4a was doing.

all in all, preorder was a HUGE mistake, need to do better and more in depth research on my next phone.",I turn 5g off. Lte preferred,"If I had bought it in full and not gotten the $300 trade in for a 4a I was not using anyway I would be kinda irritated as well. As it is for $150 it sucks, but it has issues I would expect something in that price category to have.

My main issue is the fingerprint sensor. It was somewhat iffy when I was on Android 12. But since the upgrade to Android 13 it fails to read my fingerprints about 95% of the time. Google says that is because of the screen protector, which seems like sketchy logic.

As it currently is I probably won't keep it long and it will probably be the last Pixel I buy for a good long time.",[deleted],Return it and get a zenfone 9. The size should be very convenient.,"If you are not satisfied you should return it. The heat and some of the inefficiencies of the modem used are known from the bigger brothers (Pixel 6/6 Pro) along with the finicky fingerprint reader.

You can install a glass camera bar protector and the raised lens is gone, while protecting the plastic bar. You may have adaptive sound enabled in the sound settings which optimizes the audio while assesses the acoustics in the first seconds to deliver the best fidelity possible.

Edit. Perhaps it's too late at this point.",My 6p has been a fairly good phone so far. I consider myself one of the lucky ones lol. However I will jump to the 7p when it comes out. Hope that experience is better then my current. Again it's not bad but my major issue now is overheating. This is my first pixel phone and honestly I couldn't go back to Samsung or iOS. So I'm stuck lol,"Using my OnePlus 9 compared to my Pixel 6 pro is so depressing. I really wanted to like it but there's just too many issues I experience daily. Overheating is so crazy. I have the pixel silicon case and when I try to wireless charge overnight it only get to 80% because it gets so hot it stops charging. Let alone doing anything on the phone causes it to get warm and 10+ minutes of playing games in anything but cool conditions dims  the screen and downs the refresh rate a ton.

I've switched back to my OnePlus 9. I'll have to give pixel some more generations before I try again.

Day to day with basic use it's a smooth and great phone. Best in class camera. But for me it just doesn't work.",There is a very easy solution. Get rid of it and buy the much better phones you listed.,"I had the 4a, sounds like Google has not fixed most of the issues with the 6a. Because of the stuff you listed i ended up switching from the 4a after like 3 months","I also came from OnePlus and I noticed the same things. Poor reception, phone gets hot, charging is slow.

In my case, I'm going back to OnePlus from my Pixel 6. The Pixel camera isn't worth the hassle of a phone that never works as a phone for me.","I guess maybe I'm just super cheap, but I bought a used 3a for $100 so I could get the $300 rebate. Plus I sold the buds for $75, so I got the 6a for $478-$300-$75... For about $100 and change.

Maybe that's why I don't mind the shortcomings...I feel like I'm getting what I paid for, and then some.","üòî I think I'm going to go for a 5A. I haven't had the phone overheat or anything but it has gotten warm. I'm not doing anything strenuous. Just browsing through Chrome and going back and forth between apps like Amazon and YouTube. The biggest issue though is the fucking fingerprint scanner. I'm not bothered by lack of wireless charging, a headphone jack, it even 60fps but the fingerprint scanner is unacceptable. Google should have stuck with the fingerprint scanner on the back or on the power button. The fact that my cheap Nokia phone has a functioning fingerprint scanner AND face unlock which surprisingly works really good. I'm disappointed because I really like the 6A and the Tensor chip. I think I'll probably wait until the 7A and hope that Google does with the T2 what they did with A13.","If you have a Pixel 6a, just opt into the \[url=https://www.google.com/android/beta#devices\]Android Beta Program\[/url\].

Everything runs much better with this update and the fingerprint unlock is flawless (as it should have been from the beginning).  This phone (with the update) is a deal at the current sale prices.  
Also, if you add a screen protector, enable ""Screen protector mode"" renamed from the touch sensitivity option.  Fingerprint will still be flawless with the update.","I completely agree with your comments and also regret buying the Pixel 6a. It's too bloody heavy for one handed use. It's slippery as a used car salesman, crap reception. I loved my previous pixels but this one gets the serious thumbs down from me. If I could return it, I would","This phone is terrible. I wish I still had my 3A. There some major navigation differences between the two phones, and the 6A does a lot more deciding for you. Probably the thing that gets me the most is the useless fingerprint detection.","After buying Pixel 6a, I agree with most of the point here. Especially the chunkiness. 

*This is not a compact phone.*","I had the op8 and switched to a pixel 6a, i can understand how going from a slim curved phone to the pixel 6a would be an adjustment, the 6a is a bit bulky and feels heavier than it's actual weight so it can be awkward for one handed use.  You are also losing the built in eq and fast charging that OnePlus offers and pixels don't too.   On the plus side you will gain better software with less bugs and better support by going with a pixel over a OnePlus so it's a trade off, you need to decide what's more important to you.","I do alot of Gaming Streaming recording and video editing on my phone. I had the pixel 4A which I loved. It was Really great. But After almost two years I upgraded to the pixel 6A In august. 
The no headphone jack Threw me off but it did come with a usb adapter which plugs into the charger Port of the phone. This only helps if your using USB headphones or have a Headphone jack Adapter. 

The specs are alot better for gaming. 8 core processor instead of the 5. The same amount of RAM though at 6Gb which is fine and then the Google tensor chip which seems way better than my 4As snapdragon 720. 

But Yeah the whole finger print Identification on the 4a was awesome. Thus doesn't have it. 

But I am somehow already full up on storage almost at 150gb ? Or 125 GB or whatever this has. 
So I have to keep deleting apps or videos to make room to record my gameplay. It's annoying. But That's not really anyone's fault but mine

I would prefer to see a broader range of outcomes for the 6a and battery life as this one review isnt matching up with others in that regards. Some users report the phone heats up only on 5g, so again this could be something to investigate further to rule it out or not.

personally, I am going to look for a wider pool of battery reports before I form an opinion about the life or heat, we should expect some battery life difference, but i think adam said none was reports in his experience. more carriers would be useful i think.

Edit: $150 devices from Xiaomi, Moto and Realme use a 90-120hz screen. No one uses 60hz now.

The reason 90hz is important on Pixel is because of its jittery, shaky animations. Most Android devices suffer from it.

 The iPhone does a continuous stretch while opening, closing something hence their animations look smoother.  Every frame is meticulously designed to appear as an extension of the previous frame. The procedure is somewhat similar to that of smooth video player.

From our eyes, it looks like IOS is inserting frames. This is why they can get away with 60hz. Pixel can't.

Edit: Wow! I met some people in the replies that are so heavily biased that no amount of fact will change their opinion. Some think high refresh rate devices still drain the same amount of battery as they did 3 years ago after its infancy.


And some believe your device needs to constantly run at 90/120hz even when you're reading between scrolling and when you're watching YouTube or Netflix. Display can drop down to 60hz when not in use. You don't need variable refresh rate displays for that.

Google will happily strip the headphone jack and turn around and not support their own Bluetooth offering for longer than a year... Not sure what defense anyone could have.

Removing the headphone jack is a net loss and makes using the phone a pain if you are doing any sort of long traveling and need to recharge and not loose access to headphone audio.

Inductive charging is a non-starter for travel and bluetooth audio  just doesn't work well enough to be seamless.

I hate modern cellphone tech for this. Since HO (Home Office/work from home) started I haven't used the headphone jack because I didn't have to use my cellphone on public transport, but I believe there are still no good sounding budget wireless headphones out there. I mean they are OK, I've tried a few pairs, but they break every so often and even the JBL pair I got for my SO sounds just ok. For the price I could have gotten a beyerdynamic dt770 and there's just not even a chance I would choose the JBL.

For wired you can get a banger sounding in-ear for 50. Hell, even for 10-20 you can get better in-ears than anything over-ear (talking about closed) up to a certain price: Better than any wireless I have heard to this day.

And even expensive stuff isn't all that great. I tried finding a quality sounding set for my dad: Grados sounded like garbage, beyerdynamic ok but too pricey. Settled on the ATH M50x.
