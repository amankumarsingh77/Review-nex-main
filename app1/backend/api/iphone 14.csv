"14 pro is better… more features even though it has the exact same chip, better camera, better refresh rate… I compared both on the Apple website and the 14 pro was the clear winner, the only good thing the 15 has over it is the usb C cable which is more future proof. But my suggestion, take the 14 pro",14 pro,14 pro is better they have the same chip and 14 Pro has better cameras pro motion (it may not seem like a big difference but it is when you experience it) and overall the device is gonna feel more premium if you want a lighter phone tho the 15 is for you (also you get none of the usb c benefits on base 15 because they are weird and limit it so there is little difference),14 Pro,Hands down 14pro,14 pro,"Its about preference.

In contrast they offer $350 off iphone 15 with the trade in.,"I am confused for 15 plus and iPhone 14 pro as 14 pro has better features than 15 plus handsdown but there is this battery issue that is being reported wildly. More people are noticing battery health going down to 87-88 percent within a year.

A new 14 pro gives 6-7 hrs usage time on a normal usage without always on display, on 90 % battery health i won't be able to take my phone and go out without worrying","I've had the iphone 14 Pro for the last year and I'm thinking about switching to the 15 since it's lighter and has USB C (and cheaper and lighter than the 15 Pro). I don't really care about the telephoto lens. I haven't seen any comparison between the main sensor on the 14 pro vs the 15, that would be my only concern.   Pro motion is other other thing I'll probably miss but it's not a deal breaker.",Which would be better between the two if I would only care about battery life and photo quality?,"I’m not sure if you know this but you can pinch a video in  PiP mode to make it smaller. Aside from that, sorry you’re not enjoying the phone that much. Hope you’re able to get it all figured out!",The Pro Max iPhones have always been unwieldy imo. They're just a tad too wide to comfortably use in one hand. Combine that with the square edges and it's just uncomfortable,"I use a S23 ultra and iPhone 13 PM, my take is simple, both phone have their merits and demerits. I do understand why the Samsung punch hole is much cleaner for viewing but FaceID is much more convenient to me than the slow clunky fingerprint scanner on the 23U. 
Everyday usage speed is about the same on both phones, I have a short fuse when things slow down and I haven’t lost it with both phones yet. 
Both phones feel great in the hands but with a case on they do strain my hands after a bit. 
Software wise, iOS has its merits with a bit more refined app experience but android isn’t far behind, yes One UI and android have much more customization and functionality but once I’ve set things up I could care less about most of these things. 
Overall, it always comes down to personal preference and what kind of work around you are willing to implement for missing features.","Unfortunately iOS isn’t for everyone. It’s quite slow paced (but smooth) and locked down vs android.

Dynamic island is still a joke.

Yeah pro max is a heavy beast, plus iPhones are wide. Combined with iOS having terrible one hand usage. Not a great experience.",Pro Max is bit much for me too. I would highlight recommend getting the official Apple Silicone case. Makes it much more comfortable to hold the phone.,"Weight is a pro for me, i hate it when i don’t feel the phone in my hand.",Have you considered the 14 Plus? I have a 14 Pro Max and I agree with you about the weight. Sometimes I still think about the Plus and how comfortable it was to hold haha,I totally agree on that dynamic island is insanely overhyped. I personally enjoy it but would prefer a hole punch without a doubt. You mention the sharper edges which I don’t like but are you not running a case? I would strongly recommend that you do. And yea The weight is annoying but I would rather the extra weight since Im sure it’s for the battery giving amazing battery life on the pro max.,"13 PM user here, I get what you mean. I upgraded from a normal 12 about 1.5 months ago.  I needed ~2 weeks to fully adjust to the weight and the size of the phone. Now it feels like second nature and it’s the other way around. Everything else feels like a little toy lol.

As to the edges of the phone. I get it, had that problem with my 12 too. In case you don’t have a case, get one. It‘s a night and day difference to me having a softer surface rather than the bare metal pressed against your hand. If you have one and it still isn’t enough, maybe get a rounded case like dbrand‘s ones.

As far as the dynamic island goes. Try to think of it more as „is Face ID worth it“ rather than „is the dynamic Island worth it“… it’s Apple’s way of making the space needed for the front camera and Face ID sensors a feature. With the current way Face ID works, a holepunch or mini notch aren’t an option. So it’s either something like the dynamic island or a full notch.",Pro max is too big and I never consider buying it at all. But the island... You could made the decision before paying... I might choose 14pro but the s23 is also great. Maybe you could find someone who wants to swap his/her s23 for your 14 pro max. Good luck.,I got the 13pm after have a much smaller phone. It’s way to big but I’m stubborn so I’m still using it lol,"You can buy special holder for backside of the phone. 
It might be more suitable for you in use
Just an advice, it’s also not for all","Older post but I just returned my Iphone 14 pro max to stick with my S22U.

The screen was underwhelming after being spoilt with Samsungs amoled display. It wasn't as bright and looked very washed out, plus that notch is annoying as fuck.

The lockscreen customising is alright but a decade behind android, so nothing special. 

The size, it's a smaller screen than the S22 but a wider body, especially with the bulky frame. The Pro Max is a lot heavier and uncomfortable to hold. The lack of a back button or gestures is infuriating when every screen has a different position for the option to go back. So it becomes a juggle just to operate the thing.

Samsungs gestures work seamlessly throughout every part of the UI and every app, it makes using a larger phone a breeze compared to the Iphone. 


My biggest gripe, IOS is a joke to use. Why is nothing logical or straight forward? It's so fenced off and long winded

You are telling me in 2023 on apple I can't even set a custom ringtone without having to do a 12 step workaround using garage band? 

I can't even justify the price tag. 

By switching I lost Samsung Dex, S pen, multitasking, 4k screen, file manager, side load apps, download music/ films etc. Insane camera zoom. Freedom.",Wait until you find out you can’t adjust call and media volume separately during a call…,"Valid points, but unlike you the heavy weight is a positive thing for me, I love feeling the weight in my hand. As for the dynamic island I do agree with you that it’s gimmicky, my only usage of it is music control and navigation. I love the flat edges that the iPhone has, if you can, wait for the iPhone 15 pro series as they will have a slightly rounded back for better holding experience.","You actually downgraded going from the galaxy to an iPhone. 

The hardware is good but the software is garbage with alot of limitations. It's 3-4 years behind flagship androids.","Buying a phone because your family and friends have one is a terrible reason.

I was looking into the Pro model but just decided to go with the 14 for monetary purposes.  I don't regret it, it's a solid phone and I think it'll be worth it in the long run to go with the 14 (over the 13)","I went from the XR to iPhone 14 base version and it's a great upgrade.

If camera is important to you, both the front and back cameras are a big improvement over the base 13 model that you're comparing to.

For me, I really like the size, the form factor and the reduced weight.","I bought iPhone for the very first time…I was a nexus and then a pixel user earlier. I went with iPhone 14 base variant over 13 because of improved cameras, more ram, and one extra year of updates. Further, cost of back glass replacement is lower on the new iPhone 14 design is an added advantage. Please do not believe the people saying both iPhone 13 and 14 are exactly the same. They are but only dimension and screen wise. You will also have better gaming performance on iPhone 14. Few extra bucks are definitely worth the upgrade. People who already have an iPhone 13, for them definitely there is no reason to get the iPhone 14 but for people upgrading from older generations or for first time buyers, iPhone 14 should be a good choice over the 13.","I was also planning to get the iphone 13 because iphone 14 only has few upgrades. However, they (my postpaid plan company) don’t sell iphone 13 anymore or they don’t have stocks. So I get the iphone 14. And I’m loving it so far!

So, it’s for you to decide, few upgrades is still an upgrade. Just get one based on the availability of the device. If you didn’t mind the price then go with the iphone 14 😃😃",I have the 14 plus and have absolutely no regrets,Maybe look into getting a 13 pro possibly? But if u don’t wanna pro then I would go 13 personally,"Go for 13...14 (non plus) is a scam. 

Ps: 13 & 14 have the same battery life",The iPhone 13 and 14 (non Pro) use the same chip. They will be supported for the same length of time.,Eh I'd go with the 13 since its basically the same as a 14 but cheaper,"I’ll bet the 13 and 14 will be on the same update cycle since they use the same chip. The 14 has one extra core is the difference there. If you’re a normal phone usage person, you’ll never notice the difference. Also, don’t buy into the hype of the camera being way better. Most people would struggle to tell any real difference. My vote is go with the 13 and save a little.",Sure.,"Regular 14 here, came from regular 11. The biggest upgrades for me are the screen quality and having MagSafe. Also, 6 GB of ram is nice and I definitely notice more apps staying open in the background vs my old 11. 

The 14 was free with the trade in of my 11. I figured why not get a newer phone while keeping my phone bill cheaper since there would still be no monthly payment on it. No Regrats.","I don’t see any hate for it. Really, I don’t see any mention of it at all.",The iPhone 14 is equipped with 6GB RAM. It is much better than iPhone 13. It is also much lighter than iPhone 13 Pro. The new internal structure also makes repairing back glass possible.,"There’s hate for it because it’s basically just a renamed iPhone 13. Same a15 chip, and some other pretty minor extras. You might be better off saving some money and getting an iPhone 13 or 13 pro if you can find one.","It’s a 13s, 6 gigs of ram, better modem, better heat management, slight camera improvements. Like any of the S years, if you’re upgrading, great, if not - it won’t hurt to wait…","It’s a waste of resources as it offers such minor tweaks it doesn’t even deserve to exist. The iPhone 13 is almost the same exact phone and you can get that on sale. Only the 14 Plus is a bit more exciting for being huge and having amazing battery life.

The base 14 seems to exist only to upsell the Pro model.",It's like saying there's nothing wrong for companies to release the same product every year because people who have older devices will still like it..makes no sense:/,"For the most part I agree with everyone else. But I'll be getting the 14 and I'm still satisfied with that decision. We don't upgrade every year, we use our phones until they crap out, and since my husband is required to have the security updates it's worthwhile to get the newest phone to have the longest possibility for updates. Here it's an extra 250 to get the pro, which for both of us would be an extra 500, so it still feels like the regular 14 is a good choice for us.",Thanks for the comments! Been a long while since I had an iPhone so was out of the loop. 👍,"Because apple charges an arm and a leg and is using last year's chip. This is the first time that they have done this. Nobody is saying it is a bad phone, but the 13 pro/max seem to be a better option since they have the same chipset but have better camera/screen compared to the 14.","Don’t see any hate, i guess some people don’t like that you have to buy the pro version to really feel the upgrade. Still is not a bad option since it comes with a very good processor and 6gb of ram instead of 4. 

I get that a 13 pro or a 13 pro max are better in terms of value if you find them at a good price, but that doesnt suddenly make the 14 a bad choice at all","A few days ago I was about to order a 13 to replace my old Nexus 5X but, after a closer look I decided not to do so. 

Even letting apart the software which is awkward in many ways, I cannot bring myself buying a phone with a back made of slippery, glossy glass, a colored aluminium frame or, like in the pro models, a colored and glossy stainless steel frame. It also turned out that the midnight color of the regular 13 and 14 is not black or gray but blue. The only consolation is that these phones have to be put into a case. This adds some weight but it also makes it easier to forget the silly design.

The 14 has the same queer design of the 13 but a shorter battery life, according to reviewers. Why would one buy the 14 instead of the 13?

It's really a shame because the hardware, the battery life and the long time support policy would be very strong reasons for buying the iPhone 13 and 14 (plain or pro) models, especially when coming from an old phone.",I love it. The colours rule and it does not have that ridiculously large camera array. It overall looks stylish. In fact if it cost more than the pros I would pay for it lol," Because 13 is the only real cool number! Duh… “I got the iPhone 13.” Sounds cool and edgy to be the unlucky number. 

“LoOk At mY iPhOnE 14!” Sounds lame to me.","alright guys, the differences are:

&#x200B;

crash detection 

better cameras

better display

photonic engine for the 14",It's worth it if you don't want to spend on the 120 Hz screen with an always one display and those three cameras.,"No you won’t. 
I always say upgrade when you need it to anything that’s the best right now. 
iPhone 14 is a great device! 
Speaking of the size it depends on what size you were using before. I upgraded to 13 Pro Max from a XS  in September and first couple of weeks I was regretting it because the XS was much easier to operate in one hand. Two weeks later I got back to it to check if I still hate the Pro Max, and turned out not anymore. Loving the battery, loving the big screen!","I got the plus a few weeks ago for the same reason. 14 pro and pro max were on back order for too long.

No regrets yet! Love the size. I had a 11 Pro Max and didn’t feel I used the pro features enough for the price anyway.  Camera on the 14+ is good enough and the battery life is phenomenal. I know the phone is new but i could easily get 2 days out of a charge.

13 pro is also a good choice! I debated it but ultimately decided to finance with my Apple Card vs my carrier and they didn’t have any at the Apple Store.",Not really unless 120hz and a better camera means a lot or you,Only you know what is best for you - go check out both the phones at an store,Unless you use both side by side and have some way to measure them you may not notice any difference.,"Do you live near an Apple Store? I heard they usually get a small surge of stock on Black Friday since they know people start shopping and go drive in store engagement. Check apple.com throughout the day, particularly around 2-4pm is when I’ve been able to snag an online order for in-store pick up. I need to get another pro for a friend and betting on getting one today for them.","Nah, get the 13 pro. The 14 plus still has 60 hz and a15 bionic from last year, but the 13 pro also has 120hz, brighter screen, a camera STILL ahead of its time, and it also feels similar to the 14 pro. So in my opinion, I would even buy a 12 pro max over the 14 plus.","i already dived in knowing that i wanted the 14 plus. so i don't regret... however, you may regret it if you wanted the 14 pro max but compromised because of wait times. never comprise because at the end you will disappoint yourself if it wasn't what you really wanted","60hz or 120 hz makes no difference on an iPhone… absolutely none whatsoever.. on an android.. yes , u could make out the difference.. but the scrolling is so smooth on the 14 plus that I’ve compared it side by side to my Google pixel 7 pro…. To the naked eye … there’s almost zero difference",How are you liking it?,are you nuts get the 13 pro max,[deleted],Should’ve gotten the 13 Pro Max if you’re worried about wait time.,If you like switching phones like I did then don’t get the 14 because they’re e-sim only.

There's really not much difference in any of the phones. They're all great.",13 mini,I had a Pixel 6 Pro and finally switched to the 15 Pro because they switched to UBS C. That way I didn't need new charging cables.,15 Plus.,15,15,"Left android (OnePlus 8 Pro) and got an iPhone 15 Pro… I can only thank OnePlus for skinning the OS to look like iOS and ease my transition to the iPhone ecosystem.

No complaints.",15 just for the fact that all the USB-C cables you have will keep being useful haha.,15. Better chip and cameras,The 15 is apparently the best iPhone since a while according to a lot of critics. The 14 on the other hand was not as well received since it was very similar to the 13 on many aspects. Hope it helps for you to choose!,"If you're a heavy daytime user, 15 has a better screen for outdoors use. That was the selling point for me.","What if I said the iPhone 15 pro, adjusted for inflation, costs the same as the iPhone 8 Plus when it was released",15 unless you really need that extra $100.,"If it’s within your means, go all out with the 15 pro max and enjoy iOS to the fullest 💪","15 for sure. Regular model is amazing, would recommend 100%","the iphone 14 isn’t even worth considering. its essentially the same as the iphone 13, with the same chipset, same time support, some added safety features, a slightly better camera and a not so slight extra $100. Your real question should be the 15 or the 13","15. Usb c is just a part of why. My thinking is that if you’re gonna completely switch ecosystems, then you might as well go with the latest and greatest. Plus the cost difference between a 14 and a 15 is not that big. I will say this, though that the USB-C thing is a pricier switch than I would’ve thought. It cost my wife and I about 200 bucks when all of a sudden done to switch everything over. Between eight cables and four chargers it was not cheap. I tried not to buy the cheapest stuff I went with Anker . And two of the tiny mini chargers were from Costco. And even though this wasn’t completely necessary, and is nice and helpful, but I also updated our portable battery packs to something with USB-C.","15, the only reason to get the 14 would be because you have a ton of lightning cables and accessories.   15 have dynamic island and the 14 Pro CPU (the regular 14 uses  the carryover from the 13).","15. Why subject yourself to lighting when you’ve already been using type C

it’s the first year the iphone pretty much got no upgrade, exact same internals as 13 with a slightly better camera

definitely worth the 100$ for the 15 which is an actual upgrade

or 14 pro if you can find it, just no regular 14",iPhone 15,15 as it is pretty similar to the iPhone 14 Pro + USB C. ☺️,"Android user for last 10 years switched to 15pro, it’s completely worth it.","I went for the 13 pro max, modern feature set, excellent battery and all you would expect like 5G etc but cheaper price all so I can get a feel for iOS myself. If it all goes well then 16PM next year it is.","Nice decision. Iphone 15, 15 plus for top battery",Stick with android,"Iphone 14 pro instead of these two. You got much more functionalities with third camera and dynamic island on it, for good average price. Better sound quality and 120Hz rr screen. If you have to have much battery life for one hour and bigger screen you could choose Iphone 14 pro max.",Get the best phone you can afford,Base 15 is good ngl,"I'd say 15 or 13. The 14 was part of a bit of a shift where they increased the gap between the standard and Pro models, so it ended up being very underwhelming compared to the 13. It's still better, and maybe the improved repairability is worth it to some, but it's too similar for the price difference IMO. The 15 gets a bigger jump since now that the gap is widened, they can go back to giving the two lines decent upgrades while still maintaining the distance.",I got a 15 and it’s fantastic! Hated the 13 with a passion,"15 for sure, 14 seems outdated as 15 has major upgrades from 14 pro.",12 forward r all same minus magic island,Biggest advantage on the 15 is Smart HDR 5 for photos.

With regards to what mobile device is really better you would need to compare current S & Z models with Apple 14 mobile device if comparing Samsung to Apple, OS benefits is dependent on user experience and requirements i personally have experience using both OS with Android and IOS devices.

Android have some great mobile devices available now Pixel 7, Galaxy S / Z models I personally use the Samsung Fold 4 1TB I got a great deal form Samsung the price was cut from 2K to 1K on the October promotions.

Apple in respect don't seem to offer great offers on any trade in options for new release handsets. With regards to features I believe Android are simple ahead of IOS, reverse charging implemented in 2018 still not available on IOS, 5G connection Apple came late to the party a few years later then Android, 8K recording still not available on IOS, taskers (Macdroid) or similar, root device for even more customization. Apk's for side loading apps.

I like Apple & Samsung mobile devices but for personal usage and daily driver the Samsung Fold 4 and Android OS is just simple outstanding in my opinion with respect to endless amount of customization using non rooted device, non ADB only taskers.

Apple do currently have the Satellite sos feature which is handy but in all respect is it gonna be an everyday feature which gets used regularly?, Crash shock sos for vehicle impact.",Excellent post!,"I am 100% the same here.  I loved customizing my phones, but when I switched to apple phones I couldn’t care at all.  They just worked. I don’t need side loading or custom BS, nor do I need to see system messages that don’t pertain to normal use.  I have switched to androids and back again 4-5 times over the last 10 years.  Nothing compares when you vertically integrate and you do it well.","I agree with the op. I switched to an iPhone 14 Pro 3 weeks ago from a s22 base model. I like the 6.1"" phones, but could never do Pixels cause you don't get 120hz screen etc. 

I do miss customisation of Android phones and more home screen space and scrollable widgets. I also miss how much lighter the s22 was. But the iPhone software is just more stable and fluid. No more stutters! 😍 The battery is so much better too. End of the day I've still got around 45% left with aod on. I wish gboard had a proper number row though. SwiftKey isn't as good, but it's what I've had to change to. 

Face I.d is much better. It was always a hit or miss with finger print unlocking. Drove me nuts.

I find the iphone's 12mp with a.i better than Iphones new 48mp mode though. Not sure how to get better quality and why people love it. There's definitely less detail showing up in the raw 48mp images for me. I love the hdr photos when they brighten onscreen. Sometimes they don't work though and I've no idea what I've pressed. I have tweaked a preset to get better colours because they were always off.

The Apple watch is also so much better than the galaxy watch 4 that I had. It's fluid and useable. The battery only lasts 2 days though. The GW4 was better in that respect. 

Carplay is good, I like the cards. Siri isn't as good as Googles but she speaks to me in Australian so that's nice 😂 Also, I wish when I didn't connect via Carplay that Bluetooth linking would automatically continue playing my music. I've usually set off and struggle to get music playing when the phone is still in my pocket. Maybe I should use shortcuts? 

Oh and shortcuts! There's been a bug for months to automatically change the wallpaper. Loads of posts on it. I used to love having my wallpaper automatically change every day but the only way on ios is shortcuts and they don't work. I want a new random pic from Clarity app. Shortcuts won't allow me to select the homepage to change. 🤷‍♂️

Tldr? There's definitely a few things I miss from Android phones but I realised I wanted a phone that had good battery and didn't stutter between apps or have camera issues. I needed something more reliable. I use apple pay everywhere now. It just always works. 

After loving the 14 pro, I'll probably be getting the next one and stick with Apple for a while.","First, trashing someone because of their OS or phone preference is immature; but dudes who need to gain self-esteem from their tech knowledge is akin to saying my truck is better than yours.

As for phone preference, I'm currently using the Kyocera DuraForce ULTRA because I work in a loud environment which is rough, and I care highly that my iPhone 13 Pro isn't damaged and prefer to be able to hear when someone is calling; ""yes"" that loud. The ULTRA runs Android 11 and was updated with February's security patch so at least that's a plus. I'll agree with YoYdavc on everything he's written about iOs and Apple devices. While my iPhone 13 Pro sits and waits for me to use it again with just a simple sim swap (can't do that with an i14 series), or my wife needs to replace her P4A 5g with one of my P7 or P6A is just a matter of time.  The only heartburn I have with the differences in OS is the quality of videos sent from iOs to Android via the baked-in Messages app. If you're not familiar with this, ""Oh Well"". Otherwise, there are +'s & -'s for each but at the end of the day, there's a % of the world that dictates which is the stronger machine, market, and OS...","I did this as well. The iPhone 14 Pro is my first apple phone and I pushing to 50 YO with Motorola droid was my first smart phone. I am  enjoying a device that doesn't have its own zip code. 

I hate my iPhone I have had it for months now as I did preorder. I will likely not switch back in the near term because of the privacy features and the new Advanced Data Protection. I will adapt to it. But I loath my iPhone.

I researched the data collected by apple versus android and was glaringly obvious that with android you are as much of the product as the consumer. I typically keep my data separate services with this new feature I may comingle some services through iCloud. 

I also do not like apple music but it has the fewest trackers in it versus other services. I don't like any streaming services so apple is the least of an issue. I plan on figuring out how to load my private library on it. It isn't as simple as drag and drop like android was for sure. 

I wish they had a way to side load apps or alternative store. Apple definitely gives me the vibe that I don't really own my phone because I have so many constraints on it.",It's so funny you are compared S10 with the latest iPhone. An iPhone 5 user can also say the same thing when he switched to the latest Android.,"I have an iPhone 13 PM and on the first few days that I had this phone, I was just as excited as you are. Now after about 7/8 months, I am reconsidering the switch to iPhone. Before this phone, I had a Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro and it was an okay phone, but I still had that sense of control on my phone on the Xiaomi compared to the iPhone. iPhone just feels like I bought something that’s not mine.

Once my battery gets to 80% health, I’m considering changing back to Android. Though I’d like to give my pros and cons on the iPhone.

Pros:
Reliable. Photos, calls, battery, all of these are usually straight to the point and quick. Brand new phone can last you a whole day without charge, if not more.

Fast. Like, really fast. iPhones to this day are still the highest performing phones in the market.

Optimization. Really damn good.

Smooth. Really smooth. 

Now for the cons:
iOS16. I wish I was joking. Ever since I installed this update, it’s been a stuttering mess for me and drained my battery a lot, too.

No AOD on OLED iPhones except 14 pro and above. I had a Samsung Galaxy s8 that came out in 2015 and it had AOD. How come the iPhone 13 Pro Max doesn’t have the damn option?? It’s very stupid and doesn’t make sense. 

3rd party browsers are skins that still use Safari. I hate this.

Customization is very poor. 

Too damn expensive.

Nonetheless, iPhones ARE good phones, but not to me. It’s still the end user’s decision to go for what they prefer.","apple is overhyped, overpriced - avoiding","Dude coming from an S10, not even the better Note 10 plus of that gen? What's that, android 10? Comparing that to the latest gen iPhone? Please","I've never understood why people who use a 5 year old Android phone and then switch the the latest iPhone always want to compare the two. I owned an S10 years ago and compared to what Samsung has out now, it is miles behind w.r.t software and hardware. 
My girlfriend has an iPhone XR and says my S22 is way better than Apple phones, not just hers, and I always tell her to first get the latest iPhone before concluding in her comparison.

Also, I don't understand how Face ID is better than a fingerprint scanner. The scanner is way more versatile in how and when you can use it. 

iTunes, I prefer the sound quality on iTunes so I wouldn't mind paying for it. I just prefer Spotify because of everything else besides the sound quality.","Just wait until Apple has you completely locked into their ecosystem. I have no issues with the Apple hardware or OS, but why is Facetime and iMessage closed to iOS? They readily admit that they are worried about people leaving the ecosystem. I'm locked in and I hate it. I would jump ship to android in a heartbeat, but then I won't be able to participate in my family and friend's group chats and OMG my family will have to use a different video messaging app.","iPhone doesn't play nice with Windows & MAC OS sucks. The 12 Pro Max would disconnect every time trying to transfer video files over 2GB off iPhone. Lighting ports is also shit. File management is non-existent. Apple uses proprietary file formats. IOS is better optimised, but closed eco system and anti-consumer, just like Apple.","To everyone having The 14 Pro , what do u like more about The 14 Pro then The Max Model? And why?

This has been true since the iPhone 6s. The only ""big"" single year  upgrade since then was the iPhone X. I don't upgrade every year because of this. It doesn't make any sense to.

Was already used to other varieties of AOD and this implentation is a good change that feels more on to me since it's the same image as my lockscreen.

You will see that the iPhone 16 pro will be ""exciting"" for you.","I bought an iPhone 14 Pro, sold my iPhone 13 Pro on Craigslist for $700.

I’m really happy with it.

I’m into photography, I did a bunch of photo testing, the 14 Pro is noticeably better in every way. More detail with every lens setting, even selfies. Less blown out subjects in backlit situations. The 3x lens usually just did a crappy digital zoom with the 13 Pro, the 14 properly uses the 3x lens. The 48MP ProRaw mode is a monster, so much detail. Thanks to 48MP pixel binning, the 12MP wide lens output is better in low light. The new 2x mode is terrific, it actually does a 12MP crop from the 48MP sensor with pixel binning disabled, it looks great and I enjoy the 48mm equivalent framing.

Screen is twice as bright outside in the sun, it’s a dramatic improvement over the 13.

Battery life seems great, charging speed seems a bit faster with my 30W charger, love the always on screen (you can disable it). The new notch has grown on me, I like it.",Then stop upgrading? Jeez.,"I dont have any regrets really, but at the same time I'm not over the moon... I only upgraded because my wife needed an upgrade and she was happy getting my 13PM which was a big upgrade for her.

But the camera seems the same to me tbh since I dont have that photographers eye and I'm not creative enough to take advantage of any video improvements.... and the Dynamic island is kind of just ok. It  definitely hasnt been as cool or exciting as the Apple marketing made it seem. Of course this could change once 3rd party apps join the party, that being said its not bad either, it doesn't bother me..... But the point is that I feel about the same as I did with the notch... After a while I just stopped noticing it.

tldr: no regrets its a great phone, but no excitement or big improvement over 13PM... dynamic island not as cool and exciting as apple made it seem... yet...",What do you expect? A flying phone that makes coffee for you?,"Why is there an upgrade program to get on the newest every year? This seems wasteful and pointless. I just upgraded from the 11 pro to the 14 pro having been on the former since launch day and it’s been a great upgrade. I have no complaints. Yeah, google and others have not bothered to upgrade their apps for the changes in the “dynamic island” (cutout) position, but it’s a minor annoyance. I love the screen, overall speed and camera.","Personally, I came back to iPhone after 3 years of having a Samsung. My previous iPhone before that was my XS so this a big jump for myself tbh.  
The Dynamic Island? I like it, I pretty much adjusted to it. I do, however, don't like how it can cut into videos and such but it is what it is. I'm sure Apple will adjust the position in a future model... well I hope.  
I dont care about the camera. 48MP? Cool. 12MP normal photos? Oh well. The camera bump is quite pronounced but eh, I'll live with it.  
Battery life for me, has been pretty good overall.  
Since I owned an S20 before this, I find the AoD different but I wish they did it like Samsung and just make it just the time, notifs, etc on a black background. That's one gripe I have and I ended up turning AoD off.  
I do agree with you on USB-C. But at least in the EU, they have a conform to the new ruling, albeit later in the decade.  
I think the reason you're bored is because you're upgrading each year, and I've noted iPhone dont change much year by year. I'm glad I'm sticking with the 14 till at least the 16 or 17 comes out.",It honestly feels like every other iPhone I’ve used,"12PM to 14PM I’m sufficiently happy. 

I learned a few generations ago updating yearly was not going to be wise anymore. There’s just not enough year over year changes to make it worth it. 


But upgrading every 2-3 years still feels pretty magical. 


Gotta learn to use that delayed gratification.",Dude you’re on the upgrade program and it’s been three years since you were excited about an upgrade. Don’t you feel like … stupid?,"Non-Americans: ""My goodness the iPhone is getting so expensive, I'll wait 3-4 years before upgrading so it really feels like an upgrade.""  


Americans: ""I have the privilege to upgrade every year and I hate it because so minor of an improvement, iPhone suxs!""  


Wow\~","I went from a 12 Pro 128GB to 14 Pro 1TB.  While it's a nice phone for sure, I shouldn't have got 1TB, that was overkill so I definitely could have gone with the 512GB no doubt but whatever.  I do not like the dynamic island at all mainly because it's lower so it makes the notifications lower and I've accidently clicked them many times while trying to browse reddit or whatever.  They need to rework the notifications for the Pro to be integrated into that island somehow to try and make that better.  Also the camera bump is hilariously tall.  The case I bought is annoying me because it's thin and that bump is still so huge so I have a thicker case coming that should make the back almost flat so can't wait to get that.  The always on display could be good but it's implemented terribly. 
 We need to be able to control the brightness of it, and have other options like wallpaper on/off, etc.  Honestly, I probably should have just kept the 12 Pro and waited to see what 15 brings.  I was able to trade in the 12 Pro for $1000 credit so not a huge expense, but it was unnecessary I see now.","Loving my 14 Pro that replaced my 12 Pro.  I can discern the various improvements big-and-small, and have not been irritated by the changes (eg. eSIM) that might not be well-received by others.  I am particularly looking forward to leveraging the significant camera improvements, and will evaluate if the satellite-enabled SOS can replace my Garmin InReach Mini, at least for bread-and-butter outdoors activities.

That said, my 12 Pro was perfectly serviceable and aside from the 2-years-worth of battery degradation... it still felt like a perfectly robust smartphone that I honestly would not have minded holding-onto for another year.  But my carrier gave me a great deal for my trade-in ($800!), and the combination was irresistible.

Point is, high-end smartphones have gotten very good, yet will continue to get better every year.  But at this point the core functionalities have already reached a point of general adequacy that unless you were pushing the limits of some given functionality (eg. a smartphone photography enthusiast, a smartphone gamer running demanding games, etc.)... these improvements won't be easy to feel in everyday use, and despite the better spec... it all might feel like an improvement plateau.

We are basically in a Golden Age of smartphones, for whatever it's worth.  Unless you know you will benefit disproportionately from a given year-over-year improvement, you might consider being a bit more judicious with your upgrade schedule.  I mean, unless there is some significant improvement in the camera system or some other paradigm-changer... I might even consider a 3-year upgrade schedule for this 14 Pro... but that could just be the shiny newness talking right now. :P","Idk about anyone else, but I feel like this 14 pro is a solid 4-5 year phone. At least to me everything about it is spot on minus the car windshield apple calls the “camera bump”","I really don’t understand the yearly upgrade regime. Besides being utterly bad for our environment it is just not reasonable. I upgraded from the iPhone 7 and damn I love the 14 Pro. It is some awesome device. Great camera, cool dynamic island, great display, good speakers, great battery etc. I could go on the whole day. Just stop buying every year and you will feel a difference. It isn’t Apples fault you feel bored. Imagine buying a new gaming PC on a yearly basis. You would feel 100% the same. Technological improvement is no yearly cycle.","This is why you’re better off not being on an upgrade program and stick with 1 model for at least 3 years

I went from an XS to the 14 Pro and even that wasn’t a massive upgrade apart from a couple of nice features. Apart from the cameras I wouldn’t have bothered","Latest sure.
Greatest though? It’s been years.
No one needs to upgrade every year.
You made yourself become bored with your phones is what it looks like.","That’s why you should upgrade every 4/5 years, because the upgrades will be huge

Got my 11 pro back in 2019, will buy either the iPhone 15 pro or 16 pro depending on how I feel in a years time","iphone 14 pro has been the absolute best.

I upgraded from a basic 11 tho, nobody should upgrade every year so if you're comparing to 13 pro or whatever I'm sure it wasn't worth it for you.

I see the improvements in night photography, I have to manually switch between apps less thanks to dynamic island and I can actually use my phone outside in full sunshine now without having to charge the phone twice a day.  Steel body is 100x better feel than the glass on the \`11.

Checks all boxes.","I upgraded from 12 pro max and am extremely happy. Turned out, I hate huge phone. Dynamic island is a nice thing but definitely not a killer feature in my book, I was complete fine with a notch.

However, I love new cameras but they are so big that I can’t use a wireless charger in my car anymore when iphone is in a case that has a small bump around the camera block!",I listen to music often and love that I can click the dynamic island to get back to my music app. Same with phone calls. Not having a SIM card slot has literally never affected me once. I don’t know why that would matter. I had the iPhone 12 Pro and you can very much tell the difference on the pictures especially in low light. I’m surprised by how much I actually like the always on display. It’s nice to be able to quickly glance and see what notifications I have. My battery has been fantastic. Lasts me all day and then some.,I have zero battery issues matter of fact it’s much better than my previous 12pro (suspect the variable refresh of the screen).  I even use AOD though I could live without it; don’t care beans about usb plug charge with MagSafe puck.  To each their own.,"A huge upgrade even coming from a iPhone 12. The extra brightness and120hz refresh rate is incredible (can’t ever go back to 60), the always on display is hugely useful and I love the implementation of the dynamic island and see lots of potential uses in future. Love it so far","I had a 12 PM, upgraded to a 14 PM. Dynamic Island is ""gee thats cool i guess"" and the OLED screen/Promotion is nice. 

overall it's a decent upgrade and since I traded in my 12 PM it's only $550 or so over 2 years which, including AC+ is like 30 bucks  a month. i'd waste the 30 bucks on anything else otherwise so I'm pretty happy. 

the cameras are kinda cool too when I need to take a picture.",[deleted],"I’m happy with it.

No regrets.,"I'm on the iPhone Upgrade Program so I also upgrade every year. Indeed it has been just incremental upgrades every year lately, but I still like have the latest and greatest and I am loving the 14 Pro Max. No regrets here.",I feel like OP should get off the yearly upgrade cycle. From year to year there aren't massive upgrades. That isn't different for android phones on a yearly basis.,"Honestly I feel that the iPhone has plateaued, anything from here on out won’t change the fact that it is just a smartphone. I returned my 14 and am using the 11 till a large SE is released. Other family members kept their 13 pro until next year, the 14 series exciting for a few days but the honeymoon was short..it’s just an iPhone again",Absolutely incredible. Came from an iPhone XR and this is totally worth every penny,My battery life sucks,"Also on the program. Agree that iPhones have gotten very very incremental and not that exciting. Though the bigger picture here is not just apple — phones have become boring. Year after year, you get some ridiculous android phones that are really different but also not practical yet. Then all the mainstream android phones are also boring year over year. 

The reality is phones have matured and there’s nothing to be made drastically better every year anymore. I’m not sure you’ll get much of an improvement with any other phone. If you value novelty, apple has never been the right choice. If you value reliability, value over time, ecosystem, there’s nothing that comes close yet. Maybe Samsung, but those phones tend to slow a lot in the first year and the batteries expand after 2-3 years.","And yet, the only other option is even more terrible…Android :’(",Went from a 12pro max to the 14pro max .. i think i miss the notch.. the dynamic island.. it looks good but something doesn’t feel so good with it.. haven’t yet taken any decent picture with the camera though.,[deleted],"I feel like smartphones are plateauing a bit.

I have always upgraded every 2 years since the iPhone 3G, but I feel like the newer releases have been small changes. Maybe I’m used to the design changes every time I upgraded. 

I am on the iPhone 12 Pro right now (came from a X). I got the Deep Purple 14 Pro on release day and used it for about 2 weeks. I returned it because I didn’t really like the color, so then my intentions were to buy the Space Black instead. But I think I might pass all together this year. 

Don’t get me wrong from the 12 to 14 was a decent upgrade (ProMotion, better camera, and Dynamic Island), but idk if it’s worth the $1500 to me. Plus the massive camera bump is kinda hideous IMO.",I upgrade once in 3-4 years and I got my hands on the iPhone 14 pro max after trading in my 11 pro. No regrets at all,"I love it but than again I came from a iPhone XS so huge upgrade. Don’t care about the SIM card honestly. I have T-Mobile so it doesn’t affect me even when roaming I get free roaming to the places I travel most.
I love dynamic island it does get a little in the way of one of the games I play but nothing to serious. 

The always on display doesn’t not kill my battery in my opinion. I charged it to 100% before going to bed at 11pm and by 7:30am I was at 98% and I even have widgets on which usually kills battery faster. 

At this point smartphones have matured to where there’s not much to be excited for or not much any manufacturer can change to make them exciting.

It has no reason being this big,I would like to know exactly how annoying dynamic island is because I plan on getting a pro but dynamic island does look a little funny,"I’m skipping 14, first time in a decade.","I was looking to upgrade to the 14 pro from the 13, but honestly there just isn’t enough of an improvement imo. I don’t take a lot of photos so the camera improvements mean nothing to me. Other than that they changed the notch to a pill. I was personally hoping for USB-C. I’ll wait and see what the inevitable 15 brings.","i’m considering returning tbh. i’ve only ever had one iphone (6s) and that was only for a few months. 

been running with Pixels since then. got the 14 pro last week. I’m incredibly disappointed with this phone. i’ve experienced an immense array of bugs, and it seems i’m finding new ones by the day. 

i was at a basketball game yesterday, trying to snap a pic of a funny moment. i zoomed in, camera app freezes. no biggy, i’ll kill the app and try again. nope. frozen again. had to restart the phone, and by the time that happened, the moment had passed. 

left a really sour taste in my mouth. i rarely had issues with my pixel and literally never had bugs so bad i had to restart the phone. 

all in all, regretting my purchase hard. i was super excited for this phone, and to see what all the iphone fuss was about. but i’m not happy at all.",Deeply,"This is partly what made me hold on to my 12 Pro Max. The other part being I wanted to break free of the chains of always needlessly upgrading tech. Happy to say all my other tech is reaching the 3 year mark with no upgrades in sight. But back to the iPhone, Apple's gonna start having to be more consumer friendly if they want my money sooner. No USB C port made the 14 an automatic no. Which is what helped me realize I shouldn't be upgrading anyways.","Yep I understand that. I had thoughts about going from 13PM to 14PM but the more I ponder it, the less worthwhile of an upgrade it seems.",OP are you trolling with this post?,Smartphones have progressed (actually did a few years back) to the point where there rarely are any amazing improvements. The “program” they get people to buy into just hooks you in for years to come. They win. Some people “need” the latest and greatest but it’s just an illusion.,Calm down everything you want will come eventually. Always on display for me does nothing to battery life.  Maybe you just got a lemon. I can go all day using my phone and end up with around 30-40% at days end. And that’s with pretty good usuals. Going from a 12 pro to 14pro I see a pretty nice difference. Go get the phone checked at Apple.,"Everyone that complains about usb c? What type of person are you? 

Like, I have virtually zero usb c devices in my house or charging bricks…. But I have a million lightning cables and chargers laying around. 

I just couldn’t imagine caring about that.","So take it back. I like my 14 pro but I came from a XS Max so there's a lot of stuff that I get now: magsafe, night mode photos, a much better camera, etc. 

But no one here cares that you don't like your new iphone (or that you like it). If it's not worth it to you, take. It. Back.","Its the latest, but not the greatest. Theres too many “lotteries” with this phone. Theres a massive battery lottery, theres a pretty serious OLED lottery, and theres even some “gap” lottery but those seem to incredibly minor and even a tad nit-picky.","My 14 Pro has a SIM card slot. I agree about the battery, just about lasts a day. I quite like the Dynamic Island.","I see your point how the last few years there isn’t much to get excited about. But you’ve had every single phone every year so the lack of changes are much more noticeable. I can also see how having a constant phone payment on the upgrade plane with a perceived lack of new things on each new phone could get very tiresome. 

I on the other hand have an 11 and am excited to get the 14 Pro as other than lack of USB C it has everything I’ve been waiting for. Will I regret not waiting for USB C? I’ve thought about that and I don’t think so as all I do is charge my phone and connect to Apple CarPlay with the port. 20w max charging doesn’t bother me. Now if the charging rate ever becomes a problem or I discover some use for the port that needs USB C speeds then I’ll worry about that then and trade up. 

Is Apple boring? Yes. But boring can be good. And I don’t think that is just them. I’ve look at Android and they’re boring too. I believe the smart phone as we know it has matured and Moores Law is fully in effect. I’m not interested in a folding phone that has a terrible crease that I can see and feel and the screen feels like cheap plastic to the touch. And I haven’t seen any other new phone tech to get excited about. 

With Apple, I know I’m getting a quality product that will last for at least 5 years as long as I take care of it baring a freak accident. Maybe by then Apple will have a “One More Thing” type of exciting iPhone to get excited about again.","I upgraded from the 13 Pro Max to the 14 Pro Max and I’m very satisfied with it. My 13 PM was an awesome phone just like my new 14 PM but I wanted the across the board increases in Bluetooth,GPS, Modem,Processor,Display, better Thermo Cooling and a better camera.  

I have a few friends that say why upgrade it’s the same old iPhone every year and I said it’s not it just looks the same and will probably look the same for the next 5 years until the next big tech invention comes along and blows our minds. But until then I want the top notch specs I can get",The one thing that sheeps dont do is wander. Get a Pixel flagship or Samsung flagship. Explore and discover what other phone manufacturers do on their newer devices. It will be refreshing. And then if you choose to come back to IOS  youll be more appreciative of certain things.,"Worthless upgrade for me and going to sell it again.
Worst is that 9/10 pictures from my kids are blurry now because apple cant handle the new sensor.
I can buy samsung for that but much cheaper.
Dynamic island is a solution to a problem nobody had. iOS gets worse with every major release regarding usability.",Thank you for troll post.. thank you for your service,"I have a love-hate relationship with Apple. I love iOS, the phones look great, and they have some solid hardware, but they make such stupid decisions with extra pointless features, bullshit proprietary accessories, and just overall have some scummy business strategy.","Serious question: for the people who keep saying that the Dynamic Island© is an eyesore, or gets in the way of watching videos, have you ever owned an Android phone, or is this your first experience with a cutout?

I ask, because I've been using Androids with hole-punch cutouts since they started, and I don't see how it's any more/less an eyesore than an Android phone. I'm wondering if maybe you guys just aren't used to it, and that it's something your brain will adjust to, like we did with the notch?","Went from 13 mini to 14 pro. Love the triple array of lenses and Pro RAW. Dynamic island is just an aesthetic feature as I never long press to open the widget (I am sure that I’d use the widgets more if it was backwards and a tap would open the widget instead), but other than that these phones just scream if it’s not broke don’t fix it. I don’t get my kicks from how good my phone is anymore, and that’s okay. It’s a good, reliable, long lasting phone.",I’ve had every iPhone since the 5. I’m about sick of upgrading every year because you get so little changes every year anymore.,"I like the dynamic island MUCH better than the notch in terms of looks and especially the functionality or should I say future potential for even more functionality. The cameras are great and more consistent than the 13 Pro I came from (also in upgrade program) and using ProRaw the amount of detail you can pull is insane. I don’t care about AOD or USB-C so it’s different for me.  This go around I got the Max and have no regrets. 

But I’ll be honest in response to your boredom with apple, smartphones in general have stagnated in terms of new features and if your not a huge camera buff like me or someone who notices all the differences phones will get boring quick.",Sell it then,"Sent it back. Came from the 13 mini… aod is useless at that brightness, camera updates are not even noticeable, 120hz isn’t noticeable, the pill is difficult to use with tap to scroll to the top, heavy as fuccckkkk, just realized it wasn’t worth it anymore. First iPhone generation I skipped.",I didn't upgrade. A 2 year upgrade didn't seem worth it.,"i upgraded from Xs and love it :) coming from 13 pro, i’d probably be underwhelmed too.. i don’t think ppl should upgrade every year. i’m glad in the UK we have sim trays still","I’m upgrading from an iPhone 8 Plus to an iPhone 14 plus. Needless to say, upgrading on my schedule usually makes a difference. Hopefully that holds true here.",PLEASE turn off always on display. It will do you favors.,Also experiencing the same battery issues. Anyone found the issue? I have the 14 pro max,I think the battery life is because of how buggy iOS 16 is on it. My “system data” consistently fills up to the point where I have to reboot to make it go back to normal. Shit is buggy as hell and I’m sure stuff like that is affecting the battery life. I had a 12 pro max and iOS 16 was not this buggy on it. Definitely buggier on the 14.,"Was on the fence for the iPhone 14 Pro Max coming from a 12.

Have had it less then a week and won’t ever go back to a smaller phone. All aspects of the phone have exceeded expectations and I expect to last me quite a while. 

Even dynamic island is useful for Google maps and Spotify.",I upgraded from the 13 pro to the 14 pro.. the island was cool for a bit and I liked the phone call animations but I ended up returning it and going back to the 13 pro. It’s a nice phone but I personally wasn’t impressed enough to justify the upgrade,"Getting a new phone every year is not only pointless (as the improvements between one year to the next is minimal), but I cannot overstate how wasteful it is. 

The process of extracting and refining and transporting the raw materials, the process of manufacturing and transporting the components, the process of assembling and shipping the phone... all the energy, resources, and labour used to make this wonder of technology... and you replace it a year later when it still works, just to get an overpriced, marginally better model that you don't need, that also uses tons of energy, resources, and labour to make.

So now more phones can fill up a landfill long after my great great grandchildren become great great grandparents.","I love my 14 pro max! I got the silver one! It’s so shiny! And looks like a more white silver than the more warm tone the 13 had. I’m in Canada so we still have SIM cards. I love the dynamic islands, I only had 2 phones before with a notch, the 12 pro max and the XS Max, the camera quality was exciting and since I skipped the 13 pro max, I love seeing how much smoother and faster the animations are. And I have AOD on all the time and I’ve never had an issue with the battery life yet, I don’t get what peoples problems are, I keep hearing people having bad battery life but even with the AOD on, my phone still manages to stay above 50%, sometimes even 60% by the time I go to bed and I find I use my phone quite a bit. The USB-C thing doesn’t bother be as I do use fast charging sometimes but I only ever use MagSafe when I charge and I only need to charge when I go to bed. And since I got the phone I’ve only used the lightning cable once to restore a back up, so the cable type will never really bother me.","In my opinion, the biggest thing lacking is USB-C. I’m pretty content with the design and OS at this point, with some minor gripes.

With that said, I don’t think the annual upgrades are worth the cost.","I just upgraded from a iPhone 6. What idiot buys a new phone yearly? The new phone is insanely amazing.

What? The SIM tray is completely gone (in the US models), there’s nothing where it was. Unless you are referring to the window for the 5G mmWave antenna, which 1. is not where the SIM tray was and 2. you should know if you’re on the upgrade program because it’s been there since the 12 series.","Coming from an iPhone 11 Pro, the issue is the size and weight. I wish the screen was smaller/similar to the 11 pro. I also wish it would weigh less.",And here my privilege self out wants to upgrade because all my other Apple items are silver and I’m kind of bored of Pacific blue.,I love it.

I bought my phone outright from apple for the first time because the cellphone carriers all have this stupid 36 month payment plan.

I have to charge this 3/4 times a day. I shut the always on display off but it didn’t help. That is my ONLY knock on the phone. Battery life is huge for me because in the business I’m in, I’m usually texting/making calls all day long.

Everything is much better. 

My only complaint is the phone is heavy. In fact, generally the Pro models are really heavy. If this was the same weight as the 14 base model, then it would have been a perfect phone for me.",Just switched from android to iPhone 13… I won’t be upgrading any time soon (personally),"Upgraded from a 4 year old XR to a 14 Pro. 

I love the 14 Pro, but there are a few differences from the older designs which I miss. No regrets though, just slight inconveniences.

\-The XR had rounded corners, making it much easier to hold, and much nicer to grip. The 14 pro has sharper corners that are a little annoying to hold.

\-14 Pro feels *much* heavier than the XR, although the difference is barely a few grams.

\-14 Pro is much thicker and bulkier. Phone is thicker in general, along with the ginormous camera bumps they added. Very scared about breaking one (or all) of the cameras.

\-Battery seems meh. When I bought my XR I remember being able to go 1.5-2 days without charging. On the 14 Pro it seems that I can barely get more than a day's charge in one go, and I don't even play games or spend too much time on my phone. I should probably turn off AoD.

&#x200B;

For me though, this was a huge jump. My XR was old and slow with 79% battery capacity (surprised I only made it down to 79% in 4 years).

\-Muuuuch faster than the XR (duh).

\-Screen is beautiful

\-ProMotion is definitely worth the upgrade.

\-Cameras are great, especially since the XR is a 1 camera phone.

&#x200B;

Mehs:

\-Dynamic Island still feels useless. I know it's still 'fresh' out the apple chamber, but come on. It just feels like a mole on my screen 99% of the times. I prefer the notch based on appearance, but I'm also very excited for what the dynamic island will do in the future.

\-One thing that I dislike about iPhones is that the upgrade is very monotonous. You get a new phone, transfer everything, and now you have a phone that looks exactly like your phone. Same OS, same screen size, and now you have the same exact home screen layout. Idk, could be me. When I used to hop between different Android brands, I loved seeing the different UIs and having to get used to a new one. Transferring everything and just restarting from where you left off makes it boring.","Wait until people complain that their microchip implant in 30 years isn’t that impressive anymore.

30 years ago the idea of a smartphone might have seemed frightening to many.","I had the 13pro and was waiting for the 14 to come out. After it came out, I decided to buy a slightly used 13 pro max instead as I’ve regretted not going with the PM about a month after I got my 13pro. I’ve gotten the new phone every year for the last couple years but going to skip this year. The dynamic island is snazzy but figured I would save a few bucks this year since my main concern is battery life since I travel a lot and use my phone constantly throughout the day for work and the 13PM fits that category well.","Nope. Zero regrets. I'm like you & upgrade every 12 months. I know what I'm getting (or not getting in some cases). It's a little foolish if you're having remorse seeing as you knew what you were getting, or even that you had an opportunity to wait a few weeks for reviews to come out.

&#x200B;

Nonetheless it sounds like maybe it's time you try Android?",I don't think there really is a reason to feel like you are in the wrong for getting an upgrade and feeling bad about it. I waited and skipped between models and got hand-me-downs for a while til I got this phone. So I see why getting a new phone every model can be a downgrade.,Also on the program and decided to stop. Bought the 14 outright and am going to just sell my 13pro and stop upgrading every year.,"I upgraded from XS to 14 pro. better and bigger screen, better cam, better battery life! However I do not like the dynamic island as much. just feels like a distraction on the screen but that’s my opinion. They should’ve moved the front camera and sensors a bit upwards resembling the notch while keeping the dynamic island functionality. The separation from the screen put me off. I doubt Apple will change the dynamic island on the next iPhone for couple of years. If they do and we get a new screen I will switch. If not I’m keeping the phone for few years.","I started with a used iPhone 5, then to a used 5S, then I got the 6s new which I kept until I got the 11Pro. All that to say I just traded in the 11Pro for the 14Pro. I would have kept my 11Pro without hesitation if I hadn’t screwed up and got the 64gb model. That’s being said, the 14 is a nice upgrade from the 11Pro. I don’t have any regrets since I definitely needed the space. I also would have been content with the 11Pro too though.","Went from a Xs to a 14 pro, really happy with the upgrade!","I have a 12 Pro Max that has not been good from the start… 5G never worked well. And now on iOS 16 it burns more battery.
I was going to upgrade… but now with a November delivery date, it’s already 2 months in the new cycle and the wow factor of new model phone is kinda gone, so not sure if by then I should just wait for the next one.","Came from an iPhone X and am loving the 14 pro max.  Also, the iPhone X was recycled to a family member who upgraded from a 6S.  Everyone is satisfied.",The EU is forcing USB-C for 2024. Try to enjoy the iPhone 14 for now. The 16 will be USB-C.,Been enjoying it upgrading from a XS Max to the 14 Pro Max. I personally have not had any issues with the dynamic island or any bugs. It honestly fixed all the bugs I was having from my old phone. I’d say the worst part of the phone was my expectations for the battery life which is most likely iOS 16s fault. Still lasts me around a day of heavy use,"I just upgraded from the 7, so obviously for me the change altho not mind blowing, is significant.

Some of the issues I think will be sorted In software updates, some don’t really matter (sim tray), but it is inevitable that you’ll eventually become tired of the upgrades as they arent that great a leap from year to year.

One trick I think they have missed is bringing back touch ID in the power button, it is strange to me to double click rather than just touch to pay",I had an iPhone 11 and the 14 Pro feels like a huge upgrade. I guess it is really but money we’ll spent imo. Yeah not much use in upgrading from 13 Pro to 14 Pro tho. Would have definitely had to hold out for the 15 Pro (3 year design cycle),"I feel like people romanticize previous iPhone upgrades. 

Like between the iPhone 5 and 5s what was the difference? The fingerprint sensor?  Same with the 6 and 6s and 3D Touch.",I had a regular 12 and I got the 14 pro max and this is heavy lol so far that’s what I’m hating about it lol,Yea if you keep upgrading every year there is no novelty and everything feels the same. I upgraded from the X to the 14 pro max and the difference is amazing! Loving the new phone,Great improvement over my 12 Pro.,"Hmm..upgrading from the 11 Pro Max to the 14 Pro Max is a huge upgrade for me. I know, the dynamic island is still pretty much in development right now but once we get apps that use that API, it’ll be useful for sure. 

The ProMotion display is also a huge upgrade for me. The 48MP RAW photo is also mindblowing for a smartphone, although I have to edit it sometimes in LR. Magsafe also is something else, still experimenting with its accessories. 

Overall, I’m pretty satisfied with the upgrade. I tried daily driving the 13 prior to this and still I saw some improvements in terms of performance.",I like my 14PM just fine. Battery life is pretty much the same as my 13PM even with always on active.,"I’m currently on a 12 Pro Max, holding out a bit before buying a 14 Pro Max.

This thing is so big, don’t get me wrong it’s nice for movies and such, but for typing with one hand is a pain. Next upgrade I will probably do just a pro, but that will be in like 2 years or so. Besides that what a huge upgrade, this camera is beautiful, processor is fast and I got 5G which seems good so far!",I had the IPhone X so I am loving this IPhone 14 Pro Max. Plus you can turn off the Always on Display in case you didn’t know. So far it’s a cool phone.,"I came from Android, I like really like it. The island is there, it's not amazing but it's not too bad either. The battery is really good, the camera can be better.  The only thing I don't like about this phone is the price",No regrets! I held onto my my 6splus since it came out. It was time for an upgrade.,"As someone who spends a lot of time where there’s no cellular service, I find the satellite SOS feature alone to be a game changer and a major upgrade. A lot of people just sort of brushes this new feature to the side and nobody seems to really care about it, but it literally could and will save lives. It will also allow me to leave my clunky satellite communicator at home starting November, which is a big plus when every gram counts in the backcountry.

I feel this year in particular, along with the Apple Watch Ultra’s release, is a year for those who really enjoy the outdoors and being “far out”. It would not be worth the upgrade if you live in the city and have a city-centric life that would not benefit from these new features. 

This phone now has the potential to save my life in more than one way, take amazing raw pictures and ProRes videos, and act as a navigation device all in one package while I’m out doing what I do in the middle of nowhere. The upgrade is huge and worth every single penny IMHO. Just my $0.02.",I came from an iPhone SE so this device is superior. U can make ur camera settings to 48mp and the video is smoothe. I was on the fence between this and the s22 ultra and I’m glad I stayed with iPhone because a close friend is having problems with their phone feeling hot when using too many apps. I’m also able to run my mpk mini to my iPhone with a camera adapter and make music in GarageBand and stylus gives precise control. The sound is loud and clear and always on display is nice I work outside in Florida and the sun never glares on this screen I can always see it clearly. I don’t find use of dynamic island maybe an update will make it more useful to me. I went two days of continuous use before charging and it full charged in like an hour. The chargers are icable to type c. The raw camera is beautiful I haven’t found any cons to the upgrade but also came from an old SE so not hard to impress comparatively,Love it. Way bigger and more immersive than my old 12. ProMotion is such a godsend I don’t think I can go back to 60hz,"No regrets for me, coming from an 11. Except the ungainliness of the device which hurts my wrist, the 14P is excellent. It's butter smooth, the cameras are great, and it's generally a much faster device than the 11 and I was due an upgrade. I wouldn't have upgraded if my boss hadn't given me a sweet deal on the 14P (half the price!) as I was tremendously happy with my 11 too. I just hope Apple fixes the battery drain issue with iOS 16 soon.","Just got mine today. Personally the purchase was worth. Switching from laggy XS max, instantly felt the smoothness. I dont like AOD in general, so the battery drain isn’t gonna be that problematic for me. For someone who carried XS max, 14 pro max feels much lighter. Im liking the Dynamic island and isnt a hassle.",I upgraded my IPhone XR to the new iPhone 14 Pro Max. I love the camera upgrade. It’s a huge difference because I waited 4 years. They gave me $400 for the Xr and I paid $385 for it 4 years ago. Definitely the time to trade in.,"I previously went from an iPhone 8+ to an 11, then to a 12 pro the next year (only to lower the payment with an AT&T promotion) — the jump from 8+ to 11 was significant, and the 11-12 pro was minimal, even going from standard version to “pro”(by no means am I a techie, so there might’ve been massive behind the scenes improvements that really meant something, and I just don’t understand them as a layman.)

I’m definitely not encouraging Apple to get by with the slight improvements every year by getting a new phone every time they come out with one. I’m still more than pleased with my 12 pro, and I’m hoping to get at least another year or two out of it. This has been my strategy since I switched to Apple 11 years ago, and it’s kept me from being bored or disappointed.",I sorta wish I would have waited for the iPhone 14 Plus. The iPhone 14 Pro Max is heavy and the battery is not that good.,"I’m going from an 11 Pro, 64 GB to a 14 Pro, 128 GB. I have yet to receive mine. 

I admittedly only felt the need to upgrade since my phone was aging out of that range where I could trade in for nearly the same cost as upgrading.

After reading some of the comments, I do have some concerns about the battery life and how the the dynamic island might get in the way of using your screen for apps/mobile gaming. Does anyone have experience migrating from 11 pro to 14 pro that can opine on this?","I think if you are frustrated with Apple you need to pray Google figures out the pixel line

I recently made the switch from an older iPhone but the Samsung ecosystem is getting pretty stale and their optimization has been tanking","I upgraded from my 6s+ and have 0 regrets since when i upgrade there are a lot of changes. Also i have the international version so sim isn't a problem, and i prefer the dynamic island to the notch (which is why i haven't gotten a new phone since the 6s+, excluding 7 & 8.)

Only reason you wouldn't enjoy it as much is because you upgrade every year, but if you let their changes pile up over multiple years you'll get huge changes when you upgrade. Lol i just got face ID 😂",I upgraded from the iPhone 13 to the iPhone 14 Pro Max. I absolutely love the screen on the 14 Pro Max. Everything looks way better. I’m super happy with my choice to upgrade.,"I think for me, going from an 8+ to a 14 Pro Max was a time coming for sure.",iOS 16 regrets.,"No regrets. Upgraded from a regular iPhone 11. The Pro battery life stabilized after about a week. Seriously, I have the regular 14 Pro, and a few days out from the last software update, the battery is doing great. The macro camera is amazing. The screen resolution is tops. Performance is fast. I can’t yet notice much of a clarity advantage with the rear cameras, but I haven’t had much opportunity to test them. I don’t care for how large the cameras are now, but I’m not staring at them all day.","I honestly think the 14 Pro Max is a nice upgrade from the 12 Pro Max for me, I get everything that came with the 13 Pro Max and more, so it feels like a compelling upgrade. Dynamic island is a nice feature to me, and is as much of an eyesore as the notch imo. I haven’t personally experienced many bugs, I only experienced the weird bug where the Lock Screen turns sideways.

But other than that I’m pleased with my purchase","I got a 14 pro max on launch. I love it so much, but regret one thing so so bad. Get a screen protector from day one. Doesn’t matter if it’s a cheap one until your magic John arrives, get one. I didn’t and ordered one online and got a beautifully noticeable scratch right in the middle of my screen before it arrived.

Other than that, the phone is amazing, maybe a little big to reach the dynamic island so if you really want that get the regular pro, but it runs very fast, battery is amazing but coming from an android phone I am missing a few small things, usb c for sure!","i'm loving mine but i upgraded from iphone 3gs

so it's pretty futuristic for me but most importantly

im not tethered to my power outlet lol","Pretty sure they are hating:

Personally, it feels like a nice upgrade. I actually like the island, and have no issues with it. It is probably about 1/3 the size of the notch my 11 had and there is some functionality with it. No regrets thus far.

Stop upgrading every year and you will notice more of a difference. I used to do that, it’s not worth it:","No regrets, but can see why it’s less exciting than you’re used to! I don’t see the value in getting an iPhone every year. If you nerd out on phones, it’s a lot more fun to swap between iPhone and Pixel each year so you get the 2 year difference every time you go back. :D","I got my wife the 14 Pro Max and she upgraded from the XS Max. She seems to like it a lot more because of the better camera, 120 hz and bigger battery. She didn't really need the upgrade but her XS Max battery was sucking. I think if you have a 11 pro or lower, it's probably worth the upgrade.",Reading this reinforced my decision to stay on my 11 pro for another year then buy a 15 pro/ultra/whatever it ends up being,"Even with always on turned off, my battery life is horrible. I’m sad to send back my 13 pro and keep the 14 pro 😔",I went from the 11 to the 14 pro max and I have no regrets.,"Upgrading every year to the latest and greatest makes no sense. Smartphones have plateaued in their development, if you don't want to go for folding and rolling models then there is nothing you could gain annually. You don't see people getting a new car every year and then complaining that it is not exciting and new every year.

(But I completely agree with your complaints about the SIM tray, fortunately the EU models still have it.)","I love it! I had initially ordered a 14 Pro MAX, but honestly I regretted the purchase before any progress was made. I really enjoyed switching to the more compact design was a great thing for me. Now that I have had it for 2 weeks, I am super happy. I went up to 512gb this time, since I am hoping to keep this guy for ever unless they come up with a Dynamic Plug and switch to the USB, my other 6 devices are USB C.",I am currently in Spain. Europe has the dual SIMM with one physical. Why the US does not is frustrating.When I come here I put a Spanish SIMM in my 13 pro. Here the 1 TB goes for 2100 Euros. 😡 So I will be hanging on to my 13 for a long while.,I don’t really regret it but if my 11 Pro Max was in better shape I think I could’ve waited another year,"I came from a 12pm to a 14pm, because my carrier had an aggressive trade-in deal and my 12pm was already paid off. $1000 off, I got the 256gb so I'm only out $200.

I'm happy with it as an upgrade over the 12pm, the camera is considerably better, 120hz is nice, it's overall just that extra bit more polished. Also seemingly contrary to what others have noticed, I have *significantly* better battery life -- same use case as my 12pm but I'm barely needing to think about battery life. I'm going 2-3 days without charging outside of wired CarPlay. right now before bedtime I'm at 82%. Even my 12pm was closer to 50-60 and I'd charge it nightly. 

I wouldn't have bothered at full price but for $200 I'm pretty pleased.","Moved from the 12 pro to the 14 pro max. Generally happy.

Best features vs the twelve:

- 120hz display.
- Extra display brightness.
- Improved low light camera performance.
- Improved zoom.
- Better battery. I believe it's better than the 13 if you disable the always on display and moderate the brightness.
- Faster processing is always nice (35%ish, I think)
- Love having an always on display again (since switching from Android)
- I like the utility that they built into the... Ugh, not calling it by what apple calls it... The ""cutout"" animations. It just bothers me that it sits slightly lower on the screen than the notch...

Most of these are incremental changes, but they're nice.","I agree with you. For some reason the eSIM stuff really pisses me off. 

Just not worth upgrading to for me.

&#x200B;

This is the first year I haven't upgraded annually.

4s, 5, 5s, 6+, 6S+, 7+, Xs Max, 11 Pro Max, 12 PM, and 13 PM","I've been an android user for last 6 years and iphone before that.

I find when I upgraded to the latest Samsung it was quite often boring as everything was setup just how I like it already there were a few odd features to text but the jomescreen etc was all the same that's partly a reason why I've switched to apple this year, keep things fresh and I'm looking at going back to Samsung in 4-5 years time.","I upgrade to new model every 4-5 years or so, every time I get excited for the new features of course that way. I really dont get why people upgrade their phones every year. These phones work really good for at least 2-3 years and after battery change few years after that. One factor for me is sustainability and buying 5 phones in 5 years creates a shit ton of electrical waste. But this is just my opinion and I’m not gonna get mad at anyone if they want to upgrade every year, it’s their choice.","iPhone upgrades now are more of camera upgrades than a phone. The iPhone now seems like a camera first, phone second. For people like me who shoot less often on his phone, these are becoming stale.",I went from an iPhone 4S to the 5S to the 6S to the 256gb XS. Just got the battery changed on the XS. I don’t feel I’m missing out at all. That’s not to say that the latest phone isn’t leaps ahead but I don’t see the appeal anymore in getting the newest iPhone. The upgrades aren’t as exciting as they used to be in my opinion and the prices are laughable. My XS still runs like a beast especially after the battery swap. I’ll probably get the 13 next after this new battery degrades. It saves to just upgrade to an older model. 🤷🏻‍♂️,I agree and disagree with you. I’m loving the dynamic island and it feels less noticeable than the notch in my opinion. the sim card hasn’t really bugged me either. but i do agree that this year should’ve been usb type c. this would’ve make it perfect. i always liked the hole punch cut outs in the androids and love here in the form of a dynamic island. the camera upgrade is decent since i use mainly raw but i do see what you’re trying to say,"iPhone 13 Pro is probably good enough for many years. That 120hz display is all you need.

However the 14 Pro has much better speakers, and much brighter screen on sunny days. To some even only one of these is enough to upgrade.","I’m too lazy to come up with my own points so I’ll just go off of yours. 

>	The Dynamic island is an eyesore and gets in way of text and videos. 

I pinch to zoom on YouTube so I don’t really mind it getting in the way of videos. Plus, the notch did the same. The Dynamic Island in its static form actually gives us more screen real estate so it gives us more text and video than the notch. I navigate a lot while multitasking so I really appreciate having Maps actively tell me directions. Things like Apollo’s pet are cute, but I can’t wait till 16.1 to see its full potential. 

>	Not having a SIM card slot sucks. It’s especially infuriating knowing that in the place of where the SIM would go there’s just a piece of plastic to fill in the dead space. 

I may be too cautious, but I never liked the idea of jabbing a needle into my phone just to be able to use it. Some employees think it was the only option, so having them do that without even getting the chance to tell them that I wanna use eSIM was annoying. I’m glad that it’s now the *only* option in the US and this’ll push carriers to adopt it even further, making it a standard instead of an alternative. 

>	The new cameras aren’t really all that better  than the previous ones.  Yes the new main sensor is 48 MP but during regular use it shoots in 12MP.  

I agree. I don’t see much of a difference between this, the 13 Pro Max, and the 12 Pro Max. And I shoot only in 48 MP, just for perspective. I’ve been trying to get into astrophotography after seeing the iPhone on Sunday (RIP) shots, so I’ll see if I can get a tripod and try to force it into using 30 seconds on Night Mode. Even then, I’m sure that the most recent predecessors were able to capture similar shots. 


>	The always on display sucks and kills battery life.  Speaking about battery life, even with the always on display off battery life is terrible!  

I haven’t seen a difference between this, the 13 Pro Max, and the 12 Pro Max. Everyone said the 13 Pro Max has extraordinary battery life. I must be a weirdo because I never experienced that heavenliness. It was great at most.

>	Let’s not forget about the biggest complaint from users and F.U. from Apple which is no USB C this year AGAIN.  There is no good reason for that.

Also agree to an extent. The reason is money, but it doesn’t take away from the fact that it sucks that I can’t just use the same cable across all of my devices. Even when hell freezes over and the iPhone gets USB-C, I’m still gonna have to upgrade stuff like the AirPods. 10 years. Come on, Apple.","The only reason ive upgraded from XS max to 12pm to 13pm to 14pm is Apple’s trade in values.

Otherwise, i’d have stuck with my XS Max. I loved that little guy :-)","I get a yearly upgrade through my provider in the UK and have had almost every iPhone since the 5S. The X was the first one that actually felt like a true upgrade, everything since has been evolutionary, not revolutionary. 

That being said, I love the Dynamic Island so far. It’ll be majorly improved when Live Activities is rolled out with iOS 16.1","I always skip an iPhone , went from X to 12 Pro Max , Now 14 Pro Max , no regrets ! Feels much more snappy then the 12 Pro Max , dynamic island doesnt bother me at all , and battery life had improved a lot! With the 12 Pro Max , at noon i had +- 65% left, now 85!","Had the 14 pro max ordered on back ordered seen camera sticks out a lot, cancelled 14 rp max and just went with a 13 pro max",Upgrade program is pointless. I upgrade when I feel an upgrade is worthwhile. This year I upgraded from a 12 Pro and couldn’t be happier. The camera improvements are dramatic.,"I like my pro max coming from a Xs max but I do think it’s a tad too heavy, the xs shape is easier and more comfortable to hold, other than that it’s an iPhone the user experience is always consistent. I only upgraded so I could give my son my older phone and because the battery was becoming unreliable I probably could have kept it another year.",I am having a hard time loving it.  It's such a fucking brick.,"I don’t undestand how some people claim to have terrible battery lives, like either you are lying for dramatic purpose just to shit on Apple or your device came with a bad battery (if the bad battery claims were true, why not report it to Apple ASAP?)","Upgrade from XS to 14Pro - no regrets. Camera loads better, results for the occasional RAW photo I’ve taken are excellent. Battery life, no problems including with AOD on. Not fussed about no USB-C, I have plenty of existing lightning cables everywhere I need them, and other devices I have use lightning anyway, iPod Touch, iPad, gaming controller, battery packs. I’m not in US, so I still have a physical SIM tray which I use for an alternate network, main network is an eSIM. I’m over the island in videos, hardly notice it and the XS had the original larger notch anyway. Upgrading every year is bound to be disappointing - I’m looking forward to all the incremental changes that will add up to my next upgrade in 4 years time.","thank you for your honest feedback.  I think, I will wait for the 15 before upgrading.","Coming from a mini the only thing about the 14 Pro that bothers me is size. Feels like I might as well have gotten the Pro Max instead.

Always preferred a hole punch to a notch, so I'm very happy with the dynamic island. Even if it technically eats into more screen, the strip of pixels above it makes it feel a lot less intrusive to me.

Getting a bit annoyed at the reviews and posts I see complaining about the small differences with each release. It's a yearly release, of course it's incremental! It's not really for the people who bought a phone last year, it's for the ones who bought one 4 years ago.","well, I upgraded from my iphone x because my iphone battery health is no longer that good. I went with the iPhone 14 pro the performance and animations are good upgrade but one thing that annoy me is the camera bugs and glitches. For the camera sometimes when I take a picture it is blurry and out of focus. Also sometimes it took a while to take a simple photo. The Dynamic island bug kinda annoying because sometimes it will get stuck and I need to restart it in order to get off the bug :/. I kinda regret upgrading but i think software updates will fix this issues. Always on screen is fine it drains battery but not that much. My current version iOS 16.0.2 in case if anyone has the same bugs as me.","Yeah tbh I have 13pm and the notch never bothers me and probably never will but the gap at the top of the screen where the dynamic island is makes it Way to noticeable, I would only get it for the really nice purple colour","Really a subjective matter. I’m not on an upgrade program but I used grade my phone pretty much every year regardless. Went with the 13 pro max last year (had never opted for the plus/max variant before) and I’m extremely happy. I absolutely love the battery life, haven’t carried a charger with me at all this past year. But if you’re upgrading from the 13 pro to the 14 pro I can’t imagine there would be a whole lot to get excited about. The new cycle seems to encourage upgrading every 2 to 3 years. I will probably stick to my 13 PM for another year even though i did like the dynamic island and the new purple colour.",I’m so happy with my 13 pro. I’m so glad I didn’t wait for the 14 pro. Honestly this is fine. ❤️,"I have T-Mobile and had the promos for free Xr then 12 mini and just $200 update to 14 pro. Really can’t complain when the phones are free and they giving me what I paid for in trade in value. I’m running the 16.1 beta have not seen any real battery drain difference between leaving always on or toggling it off. Been using eSIM since the Xr feel it’s superior, as troubleshooting network no more go to the store and get a new SIM. Weird that if you want 48mp picture you have to enable it, then toggle RAW in camera app to use it. But I understand as the picture size will eat up your storage. From my experience with new screen sizes or layouts it takes time for all the apps to update for capability’s. 
I can’t regret anything that I did not have to pay for or a minimum upgrade fee. I could see if I had a 13 pro and did not get any deals for trade in, that would be major regret.","I love my iPhone 14 Pro. Display is much better, Dynamic Island, Always On, much better Camera.

People are ridiculous.,"I had my 11 pro, was waiting for the 14 pro to get released.   
After I saw the presentation, I was undecided to say the least. After that people started getting their phones, read reviews and decided I will wait another year for the upgrade. Because $400usd more expensive in EU than in US for the new camera, Dynamic Island and Always on mode over the equivalent 13 Pro in 2021 was not justified ( for me)  


A couple weeks in, faith made it so that I \*needed\* a new phone, so I instantly bought the 13 Pro.

I felt like I made a good choice, and reading posts like yours makes me know for sure that I made the right call. Even paid a lower price because ""last year model"".

 **I don't regret not buying a 14 Pro**","Agree it’s a poor example this year . Returned it to return to my XS.

While I miss the customization of android (switched cause I was bored with Samsung) I have to say I’m liking iOS. Apps in general just work better and feel more refined. 

Battery life on the other hand is a big yikes. I had to turn off the always on display because while the tests say it only equates to 3% loss of life in a day, it felt a lot more than that.

Hoping they slim down in the next iteration.,"I’m not sure why anyone upgrades every single year. Year over year upgrades haven’t been worth while for a long time and it’s better to wait a bit to upgrade. This would be true for any phone brand not just apple. 

Personally I’ve upgraded from an X to the 14 pro max. I like the phone but it’s still not a huge leap from my X for what I used the phone for except for the camera quality and obvious bigger screen. I probably could of got a few more years out of the x but I wanted to pass the phone on to a family member. 

I do enjoy the improved battery life and haven’t had the issues you had with always on regarding battery drain. I do think they should of made the switch to usb c this year and they’re really dragging their feet with it. It makes no sense MacBooks and iPads have usb c but iPhone doesn’t","I can understand your point of view regarding the context of upgrading your iphone every year
There's obviously no big changes compare to if you're upgrading your iphone every 2 or 3 years at least","I’ve ended up upgrading every year for the past few years for some minor reasons. I hope I’ll be able to keep the 14PM for some time but I guess we’ll see how things shake out.

Starting with the Xs, I upgraded to the 11PM for better battery life. I loved the 11PM but needed 5G as I use FaceTime heavily and 5G is more reliable for that than LTE when my wifi acts up. I had switched to the 12 Mini bc I thought I would prefer the smaller phone but needed better battery life after pandemic lockdowns ended so I went to the 13 PM. Then I was tempted by the always on display so now I’m on the 14PM. I have a feeling the 15 series will win me over with better battery life. Trade in deals help make these upgrades easier to stomach though, it only ends up costing me about 200-400$ a year at most.","Dynamic island is a bit of an eyesore when it blocks text and such, but it's my hope that Apple & 3rd parties will soon be implementing cool innovative ways to make it work. 

Sim card I can look past, as long as my service works I don't mind too much. It's a bit of an inconvenience having to deal with the carriers to change your esim and what not, but overall not too bad. 

I'm coming from a Google Pixel 6 Pro, so the camera's on the iPhone 14 Pro are a downgrade from that (All credit due to Google, their camera software is amazing). But not too bad of a downgrade. Good enough to make me satisfied with whatever I'm shooting. 

I personally disabled always on display, never cared much for it on any device. I also disabled True tone, it made things a bit too warm for my liking. 

No USB C is kind of a bummer, but my wife has the 13PM so it works in my benefit since we can just share our cables. 

&#x200B;

Overall, I agree that Apple needs to start switching things up. The same design with the exception of dynamic island over the last 3 years is kind of lame. 

I'm switching back to ios from Android, so personally it was the superior app optimization & overall operating system stability that I missed the most. This will probably be my ""Ride till it dies"" phone. They're getting too expensive to be getting a new one every year lol.","I went from an iPhone XS that was having battery life degradation and some touch screen wonkyness (i think related to 3D Touch since it didn’t disappear after replacing the screen) to a 14 pro.  Biggest differences for me have been battery life is an order of magnitude better- even when the XS was new, it was pretty close to dead by the end of the day.  I don’t think i drop to even 50% before i put it on my charger.  The camera is also really impressive, although I find the computational photography aspect of it to lose detail or apply way too aggressive noise reduction at low light - id rather have a slightly noisier photo with some grain than whatever they are doing.  As for disappointments, biggest to me is the size.  The weight and depth (maybe due to the flat sides) makes it much harder to use one handed.  The XS was already at the limit for me and the few millimeters of extra span needed make it uncomfortable for me to use.  I kind of wish they made the mini have the fancier cameras because that’s the big advantage for upgrading.  As for performance, I honestly can’t tell much of a difference as I didn’t think the XS was particularly slow, even on IOS 16.","Where does the notation of that every iteration of the phone ""has"" to be a big improvement from the last years?

It’s just a thin slab of hardened glass and lacquered stainless steel. I love the design and overall build quality on the Pro models, so I don’t think that needs to be changed. The screen is as good as it needs to be. It’s still faster than it needs to be for 99% of people. But I’m genuinely surprised that people aren’t talking more about the fact that the camera resolution has increased for the first time in 7 years. However, I’m an amateur photographer so that’s more of a big deal for me than it is for the general public who seem to think that the camera system on the 13 Pro is more than good enough. It is good, but the 14 Pro is simply better as they switched to a larger sensor. I’ve always wanted the option of more resolution for some of my photos when I don’t have my Canon with me.

Year-to-year changes are generally relatively minor. Every-other-year upgrades are much more rewarding, but at this point many people could go three years because there are only so many updates to hardware that can be made. The big one this year is the cameras. If you're not into photos then I guess this year's iPhone isn't much of an upgrade. Just so you know, it does **not** shoot at 12mp. It shoots 48mp images that are binned down to 12mp for a sharper image with better quality. I've seen many examples and the 14 Pro camera blows away previous models.

As for Dynamic Island, you are obviously entitled to your opinion but I think it looks significantly better than the notch and it has a function now.

Why do you care that there's a piece of plastic inside your iPhone instead of the SIM? They could fill it with cheese for all I care. It was just a decision made later than they committed to the layout of the innards. It's not like you can see it. Honestly, if this is a criticism for you then you're going out of your way to find something to whine about.

USB-C... maybe? I don't know, it doesn't much affect me. I've got a ton of Lightning cables around the house and only a few USB-C cables and even fewer USB-C chargers. It's a complete non-issue for me.

My carrier, Tmobile, has a promotion where you can get 1000$ off with a trade in of a 11 pro or newer so Ill probably end up getting one of the models.",I had a 14 pro and got rid of it cause the battery was woeful and ended up but in that 14 I can go using my phone non stop for 12 hours and getting to 20% I know people say it is the same as the 13  but before my iPhone I had a one plus 7t,"Absolutely garbage phone. I’ve had it for over 3 months now and thought the weird actions were only a learning curve.. No.. this thing is a FUCKING POS. Constantly crashes apps, using the keyboard is an absolute nightmare, responses are like a crack head got my phone when typing.. It will open up my Apple wallet out of no where without touching any buttons so that’s a HIGE security/fraud risk. I thought the camera was actually going to be better than my three year old android.. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Most of the time it cant even focus. Stop buying these Chinese door stoppers. You could get a better phone for $500usd.","A little late here, but this is by far the worst phone I have had. The phone freezes constantly, and is laggy.",I went from 8 to 12 to 14 and somehow Felit like I downgraded each time. Hmm…,"Laugh at me, I upgraded to 14 and I miss my 7.","I “upgraded “ from an 8 plus to a 14 pro max. I could not possibly be more disappointed. Constantly having to retype shit because of the way it responds to touch. The most annoying thing is it returning to a page home position if I even think of going near the top of the display with my hand. And, to top it off, the screen has a crack in it, and I don’t know how it got there. I haven’t dropped it, I don’t put it in my back pocket and sit on it, I haven’t thrown it against the wall…. 

The ridiculous thing is…. I did all three of those things with my iPhone 8, and it never missed a beat. The only reason I traded up was because the 8 was only 64GB, and I got tired of having to uninstall apps to make room for updates. After 5 years of tireless service, I thought, “What the hell… might as well, 5 years is a long time to have a phone.” 

 Buyers remorse BIG TIME. I really dislike this piece of shit, and I’m gonna call my provider and see if I can trade back down. If not, I’ll have the screen repaired, (thank God I have Apple Care on this PoS), pay it off post haste, and sell it to buy another 8 with 256 storage. 

Wow, after 14 years of sworn iPhone loyalty, I think I might try something different. Really, REALLY disappointed.

Batteries are of variable quality off the line. That means no two batteries of the same listed capacity are exactly the same. So “100%” battery health for Apple is a battery meeting the minimum spec. Due to variance, some new phones will be at 105% or even 110%, it’s just luck of the draw. But it will never report to the end user as being over 100%. 

If you got one of the good to great batteries, you could be at “100%” for months. Degradation is still occurring, and the battery life is definitely worse than the day you bought it. But it’s still at or above the minimum spec. 

And if you had bad luck? You might hit 99% in your first month. 

To answer the OP, yes, it’s normal. And there are many contributing factors. It could be high usage resulting in multiple recharges, gaming, bad luck on the battery lottery, or any number of things.","It’s normal. Chill. That indicator is not always accurate.

They operate using the ladder model. It’s this tiered product list where the difference in price between devices is small enough to justify some people to move up to the next rung.

In order for this model to succeed, you need a lot of devices. Having only two phones at $699 or $999 doesn’t work because it’s such a clear delineation of cheap/expensive, bad/good, entry/pro, etc. The more phones you add the easier it is for consumers to move up a rung and add additional money to the bottom line.

Not saying there is a niche of people who want the Plus, but the same thing can be said about the Mini. The reason the Plus is doing worse imo is the fact the Mini was cheaper than the regular model and average consumers are more likely to compromise on things such as screen size if it means saving money. (I know people who bought a Mini for this reason, my Mom being one of them) The Plus is more expensive than the regular model, and most of these people either don’t want a bigger phone that’s less practical, or just go with the more affordable option (which is the regular model) and don’t care about having a bigger screen too much.

Next year, the 15 will likely get the 14 Pro’s new chip and will at least represent an uplift in that perspective.","Ok Apple, hear me out:

iPhone 15 Pro Mini, $100 more than the base iPhone.","I remember the jump from iPhone 3GS to 4, iPhone 5 to 5s, iPhone 5s to 6 Plus.

These were upgrades that people just had to get. Everything after the X…not so much. We’d rather just stay with our phone for a few years.",SE 2020 gang where you at!?,"i know this this a small complaint but the colours are also so awful in the pro. eggplant purple instead of a sierra blue?? hideous shit. 

i’m still on 12pro and i was planning to upgrade right away but now i’m not in a hurry.",Bring back the mini!,Every company needs to understand that it’s okay to not have huge growth 24/7,"I would buy the 14 plus but these phones are too expensive!

If you’re getting the IPhone 14 you might as well get the Pro or Pro max for a little extra money.

Edit- Ill add that I preordered the IPhone 14 pro max, my first ever preorder as my iPhone is old as hell. It’s on its last leg with the battery not having much life to it. So I’ll have this phone for years to come and I got $400 off the phone with the preorder. So win win for me.",Loving my 12 mini. Not interested in any changes.,There hasn’t been a significant design change since the X and performance increases are pretty much irrelevant to the average user,And here i am with my iPhone 6s Plus..,Maybe people just want phones that actually fit in their pocket and don't look like an ipad next to their head.,"If Apple were running a farm, their cattle would die off. You can't just milk 'em so hard whenever you want, man.","Not a surprise. The price has increased quite a bit in many markets,  and **Apple didn't even bother to update the CPU**. It's last year's model at higher price.","Good.

Two reasons I switched to iPhone: security update support duration and the 12 Mini.

Ah well. Fingers crossed for an 18 Mini.","I'm here trying to find a good deal on a 13 mini but its more expensive than a regular 13 on a contract... 
edit: I’m in Canada aka worst telecom prices",I think Apple has lost touch with what people want across their whole product line.,"The problem with Apple is that they're not nimble and quick any more. They're a slow-moving goliath. Almost all of the features released last week were focused on hiking, adventuring, outdoor sports. This was 2020. I hike and 2020 was insane, SO many people out. Now it's back to the way it was. Parking lots that would be completely full in 2020 are now empty with just my car. So while the satellite connectivity feature is an absolute game-changer for people who hike, that's a TINY minority.

Basically Apple released this 2 years too late.","Just upgraded from my 5 to a 12 a few weeks ago and that was only because I *had* to because Verizon's 3g is shutting off soon.

If I didn't have to switch, I would have just kept the old phone. I don't really get why phone makers think everyone needs or wants a brand new phone every year or so. What is the point in constantly buying a new one when your old one is perfectly fine?",A phone more expensive than a laptop needs more features to be attractive,I’d love to upgrade but it just cost me too much,"I have an 11, I traded in and got a 14 pro for almost nothing. I really was interested in the camera upgrade.","If they had a 14 mini, I’d have ordered one. Now I’m skipping this generation. 🖕","What does success and failure even mean? Once you're a two trillion dollar company, anything but a massive hit is seen as a failure. In other words if it's not a home run, it's a failure. And BTW, I love my iPhone 13 mini. I hate the larger phones, and don't want to carry a small tablet with me everywhere.",The new phones are so freaking heavy. I’m surprised they killed the mini. I’m not buying another till I can feel it in my hand and it’s an acceptable weight.,"Give us back our fucking mini phones and nobody gets hurt.
 - small handed people everywhere","What ""product strategy""?

Being ridiculously expensive for minor technological improvements while the whole world is heading towards a recession and rates are up so that households are forced to save money and cut spending?

Na that was genius.",It's a joke. And it's an even bigger joke that people spend 1.5k usd on basically the same device each year 🤣🤣🤣🤣,"I have my iphone 7 still and I refuse to give up my ""button"". And I'm not paying fucking $1000 for a phone!",No one needs a new phone every year. Blows my mind that people allow themself to get ripped off,"Geez, when you fail to properly innovate and add gimmicky features like the dynamic island, no wonder why no one wants the new iPhone every year.",Or maybe we are just in a global recession...,The IPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro Max are basically the same thing with minor differences. Apple deliberately chooses to make small upgrades. Only upgrade iPhones every 3-4 years to actually notice a difference.,Should have put USB-C on the 14 and then see how it did.,"Could’ve predicted that, we want minis.","My X’s cameras completely stopped working, but I just bought an 11 second hand instead because I really cannot justify spending that much money for a 12 and up.",Only reason I'm getting one is because of the insane trade-in promotion that is gonna make it cheaper than my current phone.  Otherwise I'd be sticking with my 11 pro max.,I was hoping for USB C. No Wifi 6E either. Doesn’t seem like an upgrade if they’re not keeping up with the standards.,"1.) They haven’t implemented useful features that people actually want, like power button Touch ID, user-expandable storage, USB-C charging, a higher resolution screen, user-replaceable battery, etc.

2.) People are becoming more aware of how the Apple ecosystem is a “walled garden”

3.) Previous iPhones are good enough for people and Apple is actively finding the edge of just enough planned obsolescence to bring in returning customers and satisfied customers instead of having a more “moral” product development structure","Everyone in work keeps asking eachother ""Are you pre ordering the 14??"" And I'm over here like guys this is a mcdonald's we don't make that much",[deleted],Gotta turn it on rollercoaster mode,"Poor little guy, lol.

Will Apple figure it out by the start of next season?,">	Bringing smartphones on rides isn’t really a smart idea to begin with, but the risk of false 911 calls might be all the more reason to leave the iPhone 14 (and other devices) behind before getting in that bumper car. Otherwise, you can opt to put your phone on airplane mode or just disable the feature altogether.

So the problem will continue. People aren’t going to leave their phones behind rather than just keep them in a pocket. And I doubt many would want the hassle of toggling airplane mode on and off as they move between rides.

Apple’s just gonna have to change their tech to not call 911 automatically when GPS clearly has you within the area of an amusement park.",Happened to us the other day at knotts berry farm lol,Engineers in Cupertino never thought of testing on rollercoasters.,I just saw the commercial for this and was wondering how many times it will go off at the wrong time,"“Hi, 911? Weeeeeeeeeee!”",Shout-out to the brave souls who buy a new phone and then immediately go on a rollercoaster with it in their pocket lol,Why doesn’t apple just geo fence theme parks to prevent this?
