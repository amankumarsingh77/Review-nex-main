"Also recently got a 15 Pro and don't have enough data yet but it does feel like the battery drains abnormally fast when not in use. Sure there's some background refresh going on but that isn't enough to justify it. Don't have any always on or other passive features on of note. 

Coming from an XR this has been odd to say the least.",The latest iOS and watchOS versions have a tendency to have an abnormally high battery drain. Resetting can help (it has on my watch). Also give it a couple of days if you _just_ reset it.,Same we‚Äôre not as aggressive as yours but still a huge overnight drain. 10-15 %,"I suspect it‚Äôs something to do with passive internet traffic and/or energy expended on maintaining cell tower connection: I‚Äôve upgraded from an 8 at launch and found the 15 Pro battery life pretty poor (typical usage of 125% battery capacity per day).

Airplane mode always saves some battery but I was astounded on a recent trip just how much: even playing games and using wifi to browse I would get days of battery life. This dropped back to less than a day when I purchased an overseas cell plan and turned 4G/5G back on (even while being selective about how long I kept that enabled to minimise overseas data usage).","The first few days a new iPhone often uses more battery as it‚Äôs indexing all kinds of stuff, like your photo library. Also other apps might do such things. Just wait a while",What app are using the most battery in that period? Why didn't you shared that in the first place?,Looks like China's not sending us their best.,I've learned to always wait a couple of months before taking a major iOS update. Looks like I've been saved again by staying on iOS 16.,"I had the same problem just after I got my new iPhone 15 Pro, however it fixed itself in two days. It‚Äôs probably running a lot of processes in the background after setting it up for the first time, syncing and whatnot. Just give it some time and you should be able to last the whole day eventually!","Mine is inexcusably terrible, I‚Äôm trading it for the plus","I‚Äôve never had a 120hz phone before to compare to but I absolutely love my 15 Plus. It feels even smoother than my old iPhone (a XR) even though the screen refresh rate is the same.    
    
Battery life is super amazing as well. From what I‚Äôve heard most people who are used to 120hz can get used to 60hz if they give it an honest try for a few days.","No you get used to it after a day, the phone feels very fast and smooth, the battery lasts a long time, and I‚Äôm coming from a 14 pro. Doesn‚Äôt feel as heavy either","I returned my 15 Pro and got a 15 Plus. It‚Äôs an awesome phone so far. I sort of miss the 120hz since I love high refresh rates. The pros is that the battery life is awesome, camera is great and the screen is just as good quality as the pros, minus the refresh rate. It doesn‚Äôt feel as smooth as pro motion but my eyes are adjustment. Watching videos is a joy on this screen. Another plus is that the 14 plus leather cases fit!","Go to settings and turn on ‚Äúlimit frame rate‚Äù. This will take it to 60 hz. Give it 48, 72 hours and see if it‚Äôs a deal breaker",I went from a iPhone 13 Pro Max to the 15 Plus and the 60hz has never really bothered me. Just go for it.,Battery life makes it worth it. I‚Äôve been on my phone a good amount today. It‚Äôs 10:00pm and I have 76% battery,"Side-by-side, it's very noticeable.

Otherwise, no, you get used to it. You can even end up forgetting it's 60 Hz.

I have iPhone 15 Pro. I had iPhone 11. I compared iPhone 15 Pro to the 15 and 15 Plus at an Apple Store and so everything I said above refers to that and also my experience with my iPhone 11.

60 Hz vs. 120 Hz isn't like a computer where it has a much bigger display and you have a mouse to move around and click & drag things, etc.","I got used to it within the first half hour. I returned release day 15 Pro for the Plus mostly due to the massive battery life. 

I love the phone and really enjoy the ‚Äúmuted‚Äù colors, and matte back.","iOS is highly optimized, you could technically tell but you‚Äôll get used to it after a few days, if you use low power mode on your current phone it kills 120hz","I've have a 120hz screen and my girlfriend has a 60 hz screen. I notice the difference, but I quickly adjust when I'm using her phone. I want to ask you something: what other tech do you have around you? Apple Watch is 60 hz. Computer monitors are primarily 60 hz. Your television is 60 hz. I'm sure you're surrounded by more 60 hz items than you actually realize. While 120 hz is nice, it's not world breaking (to me).","It makes no difference. In my humble opinion. I have had pro‚Äôs with my last 4 phones, and went with the plus this time for a bigger screen and battery. I have not noticed the lower refresh rate.","To each their own, if u want the battery life at the expense of better visuals knock yourself out.  I chose the better screen, if it can be better i want that as apposed to adapting to less. But thats just me, and im not on my phone all day so battery doesnt matter.","I went from a 15 pm to a 15 plus and LOVE it! So light, capable, bright display. And hardly know it‚Äôs in your pocket!","Upgraded from iPhone 12 to 15Plus Blue and it‚Äôs so awesome. It‚Äôs far more fluid , I would think 2 generations would that big of a difference honestly.

Battery is crazy good","I‚Äôve never once used or had a phone with 120hz display but even though I‚Äôve never used it or had one, I personally can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs actually a significant difference üòÇ. I‚Äôm 33 years old, my first phone was a Motorola razr after messing around with my parents Nokia 3310. All this technical shit they a lot of content creators make a big deal, truly isn‚Äôt a big deal. At least that‚Äôs my opinion.

I switched from a 120hz android to the base 15 and its not big of a deal. Using ios made me realise how sluggish and unpolished some android flavours are.
For me 60Hz on iOS feels close to 90hz on android. And its not like im your average user. I use a 180hz display at home and game a lot on it, so I‚Äôm able to spot the differences pretty well. Its just that it doesn‚Äôt matter as much as I thought it would.",Yes highly recommend. The battery life is amazing - and i love the big screen.

Totally agree that it feels amazing caseless, coming from a 13 pro max and I really like this finish better. 

No case since iphone 4 here, dont plan on getting one either.",Every time a new phone is released this junk happens. The phone is fine. People are just picking up the edge-case stories and acting like all iPhones are about to die...,"I am absolutely happy with my 15 Pro Max. It was a bit warm while transferring but this is normal and I had that with all my previous iPhones.

I love the Blue Titanium Color and my iPhone 14 Pro Max was a bit laggy. I know it was just my phone because other friends didn\`t had this issue. Now I am lag free and super happy. Battery is getting better from day to day.","News outlets need something to report on. So they‚Äôve been quick to jump on any potential story as usual. Perhaps some will pan out to be actual widespread issues, but I‚Äôd prefer to see some data to back it up before proclaiming that the new phones are a disaster.",There is nothing wrong with the 15. You need to realize every little issue is over blown when it comes to Apple lol.,I had heat the first 48 hours. But now I don‚Äôt notice any. I think it was because my phone had 300 gb to download from the cloud though lol,"No issues at all, there seems to be a smear campaign against the 15.",As I said on a nother thread. People just need something to whinge about.,I experienced heat on the day I got it which I believe is perfectly normal but none since then. I‚Äôve not had my case delivered yet but it does indeed feel great in the hands. I was being extra careful with it outside even though I have Apple Care. üòÇ can‚Äôt wait for my case to arrive.,I have not experienced any issues either with my PM,"Exactly!! I've been using it since release day and everything works perfectly fine, just like on previous iPhones. I already dropped it on concrete from about chest height (with a Spigen case) and nothing happened.",Same no issues at all.,"Couldn‚Äôt be happier with my 15pm, coming from 12pm","I have been using iPhone 15 pro max non stop since launch day (last Friday). So for 6 days now.  My favorite thing about the phone is battery life. I am running apps whole day long doing videos and photos and many chess apps as well as running google sheets, word, email apps, google analytics and Google blogs. Never once I was presented with 0 battery life. At the end of the day I am still at 30%. USB c charging is very very nice. Love it.  Overall I am happy with my purchase and hope the Apple will get more useful iOS updates to make the phones performance even better.","Finally, something that reassures me to move to the 15PM. I've been having cold feet for a good week","No issues with mine , the ‚Äòinternet‚Äô has a habit of amplifying problems","Same here, no issues at all with my 15ProMax.",Mine is completely fine.

I did have to go to the Apple Store on Sunday to get a new one because the camera was defective in the first one. But I don‚Äôt have any overheating issues or anything else. I love it dearly and the camera is amazing.,"Starfield is also a terrible game according to most of the internet yet here I am having a great time and the most fun I‚Äôve had with a game in a couple years probably.  

As with most things nowadays people repeat information like a game of child‚Äôs telephone without having first hand use or experience a lot of times. 

It‚Äôs childish but just something so widespread in current media.","I‚Äôve had every iPhone since the first one. Nothing wrong with this. Nobody goes without a case unless they are fully aware that anything will get scratched when dropped on concrete. 

It‚Äôs never a question of IF you will drop it, but WHEN.",Mine is not over heating and it‚Äôs great.  I think people are just talking crap,"That's good to hear. Mines only coming i think the end of October but reading aome these reports make me worry I've made a mistake lol.

It breaks. Don‚Äôt buy it. Get a Samsung.‚Äù

I‚Äôm loving my 15 pro max. Phone is insane!","People complain about the iPhone being too heavy. So Apple makes it lighter. Then they fucking complain about it bending or it scratches or whatever. It‚Äôs mind boggling if you ask me. I‚Äôve been an iPhone user since the iPhone 4s. I‚Äôve never had any issues with durability, or overheating (other than that one time I accidentally left my phone in the car on a hot summer day). Some YouTubers are only clamoring for likes from the drop tests which I‚Äôve never ever ever for the life of me understand their reasoning on why they waste good phones to broadcast for likes and clicks just to make a point that if u drop it at waist high or height level high that it will crack and scratch or shatter. Blah fucking blah. Never has ever made any sense to me. Like what normal person goes around purposely dropping their phones like that on a daily basis. It makes me wonder if they just do that crap to flaunt that they have all this extra money that they can just blow by buying all these extra phones ‚Äúfor science as some say‚Äù when there‚Äôs tons of people that are waiting for their phones but got beat out by some YouTubers just wanting to experiment. That‚Äôs like going to a country where it‚Äôs people don‚Äôt have enough to eat, with a compete full on smorgasbord of food only to sit there in front of all those people and flaunt about how much food you have while those people are starving. It‚Äôs a damn tease in my opinion. 

I‚Äôm 6 days in with my new iPhone 15 Pro Max and I‚Äôve not had any of the issues some people are complaining about. My phone has not over heated nor have I sat there and purposely tried bending it or whining about fingerprints or scratches on the chassis. Put a case on your phones people. Even if it‚Äôs a clear case. Just put one on. Oh and a screen protector.",So far no issues. Had 8h screen on time yesterday and lost about 40% battery no heat. Coming from a 12pm that‚Äôs an improvement,"Well screw yall, cuz I just pulled mine outta the case & my god it feels great‚Ä¶",Came from an S22 ultra. Quite happy with the pro max. I put a speck case on all my phones because I‚Äôve never had a crack from any drop with one in many years and they are thin. I put an am film protector on the screen for 8 bucks. Battery life is great. Some finicky apps though.,"I am loving my iphone 15 pro max. Moved from android to apple ecosystem. It feels amazing üòç Got esr case and totem screen guard along with esr lens protector. Thinking of buying apple care plus. Should I?
BTW IOS 17.1 update had made the phone quite cozier now üòÄ",Seems like it's more of an IOS 17 issue affecting some users . New devices generally take a while to index the new data and the advanced power heavy chip in the 15 might be elevating this issue to make it seem even more of a problem for some people. But this can be fixed with software,This has happened every year since 2007. I‚Äôve owned several models from the first iPhone to now a 15 PM. I‚Äôve never experienced any of the issues reported after a launch. I swear people make stuff up just to shit on the new model.,"Mine is also fine, I think as long as you don't keep in your back jeans pocket (something I don't recommend for any phone) it should be fine.","Important to remember that they are selling millions of these things. I think the news reports blow it up a bit. 

However, my phone has gotten warm. Warmer than usual? Well that‚Äôs the question","So far my Pro Max has been great. I think that people become hyper sensitive to small issues when they‚Äôve either spent a personally uncomfortable amount of money on a device they want to work flawlessly OR they‚Äôve been dealing with the issues from a previous device and are looking to not have them at all in any way again, so they are looking for the ‚Äúfirst sign‚Äù of trouble.

Saved myself some cash by seeing if that worked.,"It never is, you gotta ignore a lot of the nonsense you see online",My 15 pro max got really hot while browsing a certain app. May just be because of poorly optimised apps that some people are experiencing overheating.,"i came from 12pro max to 15pro max. i totally agree with you that 15 pro max indeed feels great in hands, better than 12 pro max although both only slight weight difference.","Mine got a little warm during setup, but has been completely fine since and it‚Äôs my favorite iPhone ever. Feels great in the hand and interactions are very fluid. I‚Äôd believe it‚Äôs more fragile but we‚Äôll see.",I‚Äôve had the pro max since launch. No issues. It did get pretty warm once but could just be because I was using the phone while it was charging.,"So far my experience:
* I don‚Äôt use a case, will see how long that last. I just do a camera protector and a screen protector and that‚Äôs it
* it doesn‚Äôt get warm for me, I use a wireless fast charger during the day. Also when driving and even with the sun at 90s and phone in the dashboard, I haven‚Äôt noticed it getting hot. My wife has told me hers gets hot in the son, I‚Äôve seen uninstalling instagram helps, not sure if it makes a difference, but I don‚Äôt have instagram/facebook so it could be.
* laggy: coming from an iPhone 12 Pro Max, I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs laggy. It‚Äôs a great update after 3 years

The only thing bad I can say is that the 5x camera doesn‚Äôt seem as clear as it should if it was a true zoom in camera without software. I bet the software stabilization adds noise to the image, but I can live with that.

Pro: I do love how it feels in the hand and its screen.

I‚Äôm coming from a Samsung S23Ultra, Google Pixel 7, & IPhone 6+, with my emergency backup being a Huawei Mate 30!

Yes it gets warm doing some stuff, watching YT, playing Minecraft, Asphalt 9 (I use low framerate mode to deal with the heating up)

I also use 2 colouring apps, as well as a lot of Reddit, fb, various messaging apps & a lot of heavy web use, as my iPhone is basically my computer..

I use voiceover, have a lot of accessibility features enabled & have the framerate limited.

And the same thing happened with iOS 17 to me. On my 14 Pro Max... basically everyone was praising iOS17 and how it made everyones device so much smoother.... but I had nothing but lag and glitches. Complete opposite experience of everyone else... again lol!","Yea give it a few days, the phone is likely still doing some background stuff.

(Just ordered mine btw, gotta wait 7 weeks)","Every single post I see saying ‚Äúthe battery life is not that great‚Äù baffles my mind. 
I got a 15 pro max on Saturday, out of the box had 75% battery. I was to lazy to wait at the store so I downloaded an iCloud backup on just the battery on my hour drive home‚Ä¶
I charged it that same Saturday night, it now 6:15pm on Monday and I still have 37%‚Ä¶ from that same charge‚Ä¶

Idk what people do with their phones but y‚Äôall gotta put the phone down and go read a book or something XD

Edit: to go off this even more, do people just forget or ignore that BRAND NEW PHONES don‚Äôt have the same machine learning about your charging habits as a phone you have had for a couple months. Literally says it in the settings under Battery.

Not much screen on time yesterday but it feels like it‚Äôs draining slower than my 14PM when not in use.",So did we forget initially setting up the iPhone drains the battery a ton? Give it a few days for it to settle,"Moved from a regular 12 to a 15 Pro Max and loving it so far. My main concern was the size, but so far it hasn‚Äôt been that bad. I mostly use my phone two-handed (and I did the same with the 12). But in scenarios where I only have one hand, I can usually juggle it around to make it work. 

Battery life is MUCH better than my 12. I use my phone quite a bit at work, and was often coming home with around 30%. Today I came home with 70% on the Pro Max after a pretty typical day. Cameras are quite a bit better of course, but I‚Äôm never terribly impressed with phone photography. 

What I‚Äôve really loved about the phone is just how nice it is. I have the Natural Titanium model and it looks stunning and feels so nice in my hand. The textured glass on the back of the phone feels soooooo nice. There‚Äôs definitely a weight difference, but I think it‚Äôs worth it for the size and better materials.

As far as issues, I‚Äôve noticed a lack of touch responsiveness here and there. It‚Äôs very occasional, but I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs ironed out with a software update. Overall, super happy with the upgrade and really glad that I got the Max model.","Battery life is great, heat is acceptable and nowhere near what people are saying IMO, 5x lens is great. The phone is much zippier than my 14 Pro Max even, which I was not expecting. The weight and feel of the phone in hand is a hundred times better too. No case, no plans for one. Love the phone.

&#x200B;

Just know that phones can and do get hot and it's totally normal and within spec. It's a computer for your pocket with immense power. Heat is normal. It will likely run hotter and have reduced battery life for the first 36-72 hours while things index.","Battery life has been fine, depends what you‚Äôre doing on your phone though.  Heat is an issue when recording video so far I‚Äôve noticed.","Your phone is still indexing.

I did iPhone to iPhone transfer and that kept its index information so it didn‚Äôt take long after the transfer


I used my phone yesterday from about 6am to 9pm and had 13% left",15 PM here.. I had over 10 hours screen on yesterday and got to around 23% left. I don‚Äôt use AOD but other than that just normal usage,"Mine is doing awesome so far, no complaints whatsoever and I came to it from a galaxy s22 ultra.

Blue Titanium 512 gig 15 pro max. Seems like a pretty smooth solid working phone and the sound quality on calls and watching YouTube is pretty good. I give it two thumbs up thus far üëçüëç",Eating the shit out of my battery,Dear god. Another fkin battery post,My fuckin screen scratches so easily.. am I the only one? Damn,14PM has a v bad battery too. I really hope they focus on battery next year,"I used my 15pm for the first time today and got less SOT than I was getting on my 14 pro (non max) with 87% battery health. Was just chewing the battery away sitting in my pocket. I‚Äôm putting it down to background processes due to first time set up, but I‚Äôm going to give it a few more days before I do a fresh iOS install and then restore from and iCloud backup rather than direct transfer","I‚Äôm coming from a 14 pro with a 90% battery and honestly the battery is not that much better. I‚Äôll give it a few days for the indexing and such to finish.  But overall I‚Äôm not that impressed.   

Also my series 7 watch won‚Äôt pair to it right no matter what.  I‚Äôve reset and erased settings 3 times so far and it won‚Äôt vibrate when I get a text or call with my phone on silent also complications won‚Äôt update.  I paired back to my iPhone 14 pro and everything works as it should.  I‚Äôm seeing a lot of people have watch issues with their new phones.   There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to buy a new series 9 watch when my 7 was working fine with my iPhone 14.  Majorly disappointed so far with the watch.","The last Pro Max I had was the 13 Pro Max, and the 15 PM is definitely nowhere near it from a battery stamina perspective so far. I remember on Day 2 I was blown away by the battery. This is now day 4, so we‚Äôll see how it does. I also noticed that the 15PM wall gets warmer than previous iPhones during normal use as well.",I used it for 2 hours straight and used 15%.,"My battery has been great. Everything on it has been great. I‚Äôm going without a case at the moment, this phone is beautiful in the black finish.","Battery is meh coming from a regular 13 pro. Was hoping for crazy time.  Camera is nice and the bigger screen. Just starting to have buyers remorse and might use the return window.   Phone did get hot when charging via usb c. 
Also cant decide which case to get. Usually case less except for when doing sports and such.","Battery life is meh compared to 14PM about the same. But heating is a huge issue, it‚Äôs very hot even when listening to Spotify with the screen off.",I copied over my settings and apps with ios17 from my 13 pro max to my 15 pro max and I was shocked at how bad the battery is on the 15 pro max. My 2 year old 13 pro max with a battery health of 88% would last way longer (almost 3 hours longer) than the 15. I‚Äôm not sure why when I went setting for setting.,"Battery life is the most subpar for any max iPhone I‚Äôve ever owned. I‚Äôd take it off the charger at 7am and by noon it‚Äôs already down to 60%. My 12 and 13 PM would have well over 80% battery around the same time. I haven‚Äôt changed how I use my phone but have the always on display on without showing my wallpaper. 

Love the feel and materials of the phone tho. I‚Äôd say the updated design makes it much more comfortable in the hand.",I‚Äôm loving it. I came from a 12 Pro Max. Battery seems on par if not better despite having an always on screen. The screen is fantastic. I‚Äôm loving the much blacker blacks and the refresh rate. Everything is verrry smooth. I‚Äôm also a huge fan of the camera and dynamic island. I have zero complaints.,"15PM had to charge twice yesterday. Once in the morning from the overnight before. Once around 4 pm.

Used Google map, calls via Signal, for that morning charge. And afternoon charge was mostly photos and google maps. Overall spent about 10 hours on screen time. 

This morning went for a 1.5 hr drive with Apple Music. Went from 80-65% from an overnight charge.

Not sure if good or bad.","Little bit of back story in June I went to a lake and my 12PRO MAX (12pm) is at the bottom of said lake. I knew the new iPhone was getting a USB c port so I filled art insurance got the replacement and gave it to my fianc√©. From there I used a zfold4 (bought it used so I could have a tablet for work) until September. SO overall I'm happy, my messages are blue again and hooking up my phone to my TV is such a better experience but. Overall performance really didn't shock me compared to 12pm I play genshin on my phone and that's gonna be the real test going forward. I like to play at 60fps on that game and it really has been good looking (way better than the zfold4) graphically it beats the 12pm and the zfold4 but like I said it really gonna be a test of time. Otherwise I'm happy and don't have buyers remorse. I needed an iPhone and well truthfully had there not been a USB c port I would have bought the 14pro max and been done with it.","If you literally just bought it, then the iPhone is working constantly in the background indexing and arranging itself. Give it a couple days before worrying about the battery

If it gets too hot, it will temporarily stop charging. Leave it out of any case or sitting on top of its case, when overnight charging for the first few times to maximize the airflow and passive cooling.

Idle time is the amount of time the phone is on without or without the AOD active, but you aren‚Äôt actually doing anything.",I got 8 hours SOT from 80% to about 35%. AOD off.,"It's great! Battery life is better than my 13 Pro Max, although as expected with a bigger battery and 12% more battery capacity.","Battery seems amazing on my end. From 80% this morning to 39% right now with 6h of on screen time.

It got a bit hot real quick once when I watched videos while charging but nothing crazy. Nothing close to people describing the phone too hot to handle like I‚Äôve seen.","XS Max to a 15PM, couldn't be happier with the upgrade and the battery life seems perfectly fine with me, no issues",Turn off wallpaper for the AOD.,"Idk. I took it off the charger 7am Saturday and it didn‚Äôt need a charge until 4pm Sunday. I was happy about that. It even made it through a wedding and photos. 

Are you sure you weren‚Äôt just doing the over using the new phone thing at the same time it‚Äôs still indexing and settling kind of deal?",I‚Äôve had it since launch day and been perfectly fine with it. I run a business from my phone as well as chronically online and I can‚Äôt tell it being significantly worse or better. Ultimately though I‚Äôm not going to be mad if it is slightly less. I do LOVE how much lighter it feels and the rounded edges are so much more comfortable. That‚Äôs worth it to me,"My phone was hot near the volume buttons for the first day. It was pulling an iCloud backup though. My battery has been awesome since day 2, and the heat issue stopped, I guess due to the restore and other tasks being completed.","I went from an iPhone 11 Pro to a 15 Pro Max and I will never go back to a smaller phone. The battery life, the screen real estate, and the new phone itself is just so gorgeous and beautiful to hold and look at. Not feeling any heat and the battery life has lasted me more than a day.",Mine overheated when using CarPlay but other than that‚Äôs its great,Once I got past my music sync issues it‚Äôs been smooth sailing. Battery seems fine now that all the restoring form icloud is done.,"I am wondering if I really want 15 PM right now and if I should return it until it is resolved.

From this review, it seems that the A17 Pro's CPU P cores are strong but power hungry. A17 Pro's GPU at least for traditional GPU benchmark it is not as powerful and efficient as 8 Gen 2. GPU when it comes to ray tracing is the most powerful but again eats a lot power too.

It seems like A17 Pro is a power hungry SoC and I am not sure if it is possible for Apple to resolve that except throttling and making the performance takes a hit.",I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs not much difference between the 13 max and 15 max in battery,"Compared to my 12 Mini, battery is amazing. I unplugged my 15 Pro Max at about 10am and when I was got home from work at 12am I still have 54%",How long ago did you buy it? Is it doing the initial indexing and syncing of all your data?,Battery drain has me concerned. First day I just brushed it off as ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs working hard to index everything. Makes sense‚Äù. But today I haven‚Äôt really used it for much of anything since I‚Äôm at work and somehow it dropped 20% anyway,Well for me the auto focusing on my 15 pro max isn‚Äôt working that well when getting close. Only in the camera app. But 3rd party apps it doesn‚Äôt autofocus. I can‚Äôt DoorDash or even use banking apps to deposit checks.,If you just got the phone and have your backup on iCloud it can be downloading your pics/vids etc in the background.,Love mine. Great battery life. I was basically using it the whole day on day 1 and it took me through no problem. Fast charging gets 50% battery recharge in 30 minutes. I can‚Äôt complain.,"Yes I‚Äôve noticed the same thing!! Coming from a 13 Pri Max. Noticed my 15 PM gets really warm during basic tasks and also dies a lot faster.

Have had it since 9am on launch day so you‚Äôd think any ‚Äúindexing‚Äù is done. Nothing is downloading from iCloud anymore. Strange.

Even if I‚Äôm on WiFi and just using Reddit it gets very warm.","You gotta give it at least a week or so before you even begin to focus on battery consumption. As others have said, there are often lots of background tasks like iCloud syncing... even third party apps like Lightroom have lots of photos and databases doing things in the background on a new phone that can take time.

Not to mention most people are far more active with their phones every minute of every hour that first week.","Battery life is noticeably better than my 14 Pro was, and that wasn‚Äôt bad either. I haven‚Äôt experienced any camera heat. 

There was an iOS update out of the box, which does affect battery life for a couple of days as a bunch of indexing happens in the background afterwards. Were you on WiFi or cellular? Was it a decent connection or not?",It's working great. No complaints. I used to care about SOT. not anymore. It doesn't affect me in anyway. During the day I plug it to re-charge and continue with my day.,It‚Äôs Yuuuge,Still gets a little hotter than I like but it‚Äôs not as bad as the 14 pro max. Battery is pretty much the same,That SOT sounds bad you should have it brought in to an Apple Store,"I had the 12 pro max before this and it's working great. I haven't bothered to look at the battery stats cuz it's something I couldn't care less about, but it seems the battery is lasting a while with a lot of use and minimal charging.","Zero issues, working as expected",When I first grabbed mine it felt like a toy. Still got give some more use to get a full thought on it,"I‚Äôve been getting \~7-9 hours of SoT a day on mine, which I consider pretty good. I‚Äôve actually noticed almost 0 heat (except while charging) which, coming from a 14 Pro, is awesome

3.5 hours today, took it off the charger at 7 am, 57% currently. Pretty good.","Man I had 5h12m active screen time and 4h59m idle screen time yesterday and used between 50-55% battery. Not sure whats going on with yours, and that's with AOD, 120hz, and roaming on","I went from the 13 pro max to the 15 pro max and I do notice the battery isn‚Äôt as good as it was on the previous version. It‚Äôs not horrible, just not that great. My battery health was at 96%. 

I did make a post on here about how the AirPods wouldn‚Äôt connect on the 15 pro max but come to find out that it was a very good knock off. Verified them at the Apple Store and apparently these newer models have made it harder to use knock off items lol (so be careful buying off eBay üòÇ). 

So far I‚Äôm loving the phone. It‚Äôs smooth, no glitches or lagging. And I‚Äôm glad I stuck to the white titanium color.",i mean i took like 5 pictures today and it was way too hot,Every major iOS version it seems to take the apps a couple of weeks to become stable and not waste a ton of battery.  That is why some people are having horrible battery performance while others are saying it is great.  Test by getting rid of all apps you just don't use anymore and go from there.  Like I said after a few updates it always seems to go away (battery complaints).,Are you at full brightness?,Heat has been less than 13 pro max in similar usage but the battery is absolute trash tier. I hope it‚Äôs a glitch or something because this is terrible,"I like it but for some reason my 14 PM was my favorite iPhone I‚Äôve ever had. I think the silent icon in status bar is a nice add that should be also displayed on devices with a physical button. For some reason the phone does seem a bit laggier though. 

I always have low power mode enabled and have a shortcut that enables it automatically when removed from charger. I prefer longer lasting battery over the 120hz","I had the phone since launch day and overall it feels very smooth and it's blazing fast, but my main concerns are the heat when charging and the sub-par battery life. It's definitely a step up from the 14 Pro but still trails behind the 13 Pro Max; the king of battery life. Granted, it's only been 3 days. We'll how the iOS updates change things.. But man, the new brushed sides and lighter weight are a blessing. I sometimes regret upsizing again, but I just have to get used to it. It's much more manageable now.",I'm at 7 Hours SOT and 31% left,They probably haven‚Äôt optimized the battery life they will when they update iOS,Some people across all iphones have been complaining about the battery draining faster on ios 17.0.2,I haven‚Äôt put my phone on the charger once today and it‚Äôs at 33% at 1:55 am and I started using it at roughly 8am this morning. The battery is leagues better than my previous 14PM imo,I am using it from 22nd. After two days the battery backup has improved. The phone is optimizing and your files maybe syncing in the background all these factors could be affecting. Give it a week,"I‚Äôm getting average 6 hours of SOT on my 15 pm, pretty disappointed tbh. Was getting around 5 hours on 13 pro",Idk. I didn‚Äôt ask my phone if it likes me. How‚Äôs your doing with you?,Battery life is great and no heating issues here. You do have to understand that the first few days the phone is going to be doing a lot in the background so give it a week and it should improve.,"Mine has been great. I turned on the feature to limit charging to 80%. Yesterday was a dreary, boring day, the sort of day where I‚Äôd end up having to charge my phone because I‚Äôm using it a lot, but at bedtime it was still at about 30%.",It takes close to a week for a new iPhone to finish syncing and indexing,Battery seems better than 14.,"Battery is meh for me. Definitely not getting the ""27 hours"" of video playback lol.

Semi-related: I for sure like the action button a lot more than I thought, though.","Been using it since Friday, set the battery to max 80%, been working fine for me, no heat issues that I can‚Äôt tell (I do have a case on it), like the upgrade from my 13MP, so all good here.","Compared to my old 14PM, the 15PM has the exact same not that great battery.",It‚Äôs probably my still indexing. Mine takes a few days to get to acting normal again.,Give it some time. Your phone is still cataloging,"I don‚Äôt think my battery life is too bad. Way better than my 13 PM was. My phone does not get hot like you mentioned either, unless I‚Äôm charging it. It was also a little warm when I was first setting up, but that was expected and it hasn‚Äôt gotten that way since.",My battery dropped 20% with 5 hours of SOT. I‚Äôm happy with it,Battery life has been ok. The phone came out on the same weekend as my brothers wedding so I was able to really put it to the test. Despite using the camera quite a bit and using Google maps for various travels I ended the day with about 50% and 3 hours of SOT each day this weekend.,"I've canceled my iPhone 15 order, twice. Obviously going to wait. But I have read the battery can take a week to settle into the user's patterns.   
I also have read about the heat issues. Most recently said that just looking through the photos app or Google Photos was causing the phone to heat up.   
But I'm sure Apple will push a software update sooner or later for this.",Battery sucks. Returning and going back to 14 PM.,Battery is very bad. My 12 pro max that i upgraded from had better life. But everything else about the phone is incredible. Love the phone,I am very happy with it. Massive upgrade from my 14PM,Update: 4 hours screen time and battery is ~30%. How can i know what is causing the battery to drain?,https://preview.redd.it/2ds62a7ibfqb1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83fd7c395554c05b265b9c3158ce9b36314bae44,"I‚Äôve had the good ol days of the 13 pro max battery life in my experience. So far so good. Had my phone off the charger at 5:30 this morning. 2 hours SOT, it‚Äôs 8:30 now and I have 84%. May 13 pro (6.1) would be at 50% by now lol",You might have a bad unit.,"Battery has been great, apart from the initial boot up when it was trying to download everything from iCloud in the background but that makes sense.

I am having issues with iMessage though. I have some messages sporadically there but not all, especially older ones with videos, pictures, and links. If anyone knows how to fix that, any input would be greatly appreciated.","Amazing, all weekend I‚Äôve only had to charge it for like an hour. 

I‚Äôm coming from the original iPhone X and it‚Äôs MILES better than that phone, 15pm is insanely faster, and also like 5x as loud, the 15pm on like 1/4 volume is louder than my X. 

Overall it‚Äôs fantastic, imo I prefer the design of the X and didn‚Äôt want to get rid of it but the battery was so bad I could sit in the Home Screen and watch the battery drain on its own without doing anything, so it was time for an upgrade.","https://preview.redd.it/ivhfd2mvhgqb1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=389b276f554a3f6f44c1d428456ba27f0c741214

9 hours at 74% remaining lol. In all honesty I haven‚Äôt used it much today , couple texts , one face time call and couple of YouTube videos and an hour of YouTube audio. Amazing battery life though. I realized yesterday that I didn‚Äôt reboot this device since it was new, so I did that as well. I like to that every so often , especially a couple days after a restore.","my iPhone 15 pro max does nothing yet, because in the shitty country I live, they can't even do pre orders right, so all I got right now, is a hypothetical iphone 15 pro max in black and I love it -.-","Hard to believe how dumb some people are.

* The phone is brand new, of course the battery is not at its peak yet because it hasn't learned to yet.
* You didn't feel any heat it's all in your head.

Stop having buyer's remorse and let it settle in and don't obsess over small thing's.",Seems to be better than the 14PM but not at 13PM levels. I made it through yesterday with 17% left at 10pm. I‚Äôm good.,"coming from a normal 14 pro, the 15 pro max has been amazing so far. I was reluctant to go max for a long time and finally took the leap.",Very good,"Other than being impressed by the weight difference from the 14PM, I haven‚Äôt given it much too much thought, maybe in a few days after it adjusts to all the software updates I will focus on the battery 

Side note: got the phone on launch day and in the evening it just turned itself off, after 30 minutes of trying to force restart, it restarted, this has never happened before but it is now working as expected","Yesterday I got 7 hours of screen-on time with 50% left to spare, it hasn‚Äôt got hot not even when installing all the apps or charging so my experience has been flawless. 

However I should note that I turned off AOD and raise to wake, not to preserve battery life necessarily but because I don‚Äôt like those features lol","Mine was abysmal during initial setup, but has been flawless after that. No heat, great battery life. Took it off the charger at 654am and by 9pm i still had about 20% left, and I was using it for tiktok and amazon and a few league of legends rounds and texting throughout the day.","Turn background app refresh to ""wifi only"" and also fine tune some of the location settings, helped drastically for me.","https://preview.redd.it/ihlvaxhzthqb1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01755f18252d19ed7aa0c67efb00ce48d1f73f77

From 100 to 5%, got it on friday and same results since then. No low power mode or anything",My husband‚Äôs arrived before mine did. He cannot get the App Store to utilize the Face ID to download apps. He has to enter in his password over and over.,[deleted],"First day or so, the phone is doing ""system optimization"" or something to that effect. Finder indexing, that kinda thing. Mine did that for a few hours and was quite toasty, now it's cold as always.

Give it a couple days before you cast judgement on the battery. Especially if you're playing with your new toy a bunch more than you used to use your phone, of course the battery isn't going to last as long.","had a few little issues minor issues with my 15 pro max. 1st i also noticed on my belkin 3 in 1 stand first night the phone was very hot on the stand i ended up taking it off.  2nd  my phone would not rotate for videos( this fixed with a restarted)

I have phone on charger now curious to see if it got hot after 100% haven't charged it up to 100% since i got the phone.   i do a lot of random charging car phone/stand is magsafe so charges when i drive.",Apples calculation of SOT isn't based on the last time it was fully charged. So it ain't accurate.,My iphones always do this when new.  For me its photos and music downloads and sync.  Day 2 they settle down.. YMMV,"Have you literally just got it? Maybe it‚Äôs indexing.  Mine is excellent battery, at least equal to my 13 pro max","Mines pretty good! 7hrs SOT(on wifi) with 54% left. 

But i'm gonna return mine because of dead pixel and dust under front and back camera :/",my battery life is great so far 15 pro max sounds like something‚Äôs wrong,I'm coming from a i-phone Xs so this is a major change.  The best way I can describe my issue is the screen looks concave like a 3 D effect.  Maybe its my eyes but almost seems like the middle of the screen is lower like looking into very shallow bowl when looking at articles and apps.  Is this normal on the newer phones?,"The volume of my text alert is verrrry loud even tho the ringtones sound is turned way down.   Could be operator error lol
Also I hate that all the AI learned words and spelling is not carried over. Phrases and words aren‚Äôt recognized. But this phone feels much better than the 14 PM. And for the love of anything, that period key on the keyboard drives me crazy.","I genuinely feel bad for you iPhone users. You shouldve known the 48 megapixel main camera has existed since 2017 and Apple still finds ways to pass tbis off as ""new"". Now for the iPhone 15's top feature USB-C something they shouldve integrated so long ago, but of course wanted to trap their consumers into their ""Apple Environment"", and limit your options, ignoring your pleads until they finally take their heads out of their ass, seeing as basically 99% has had USB-C integration since the last 6 years. Then they try covering all this nonsense by giving you a titaniun frame, which causes discoloration even at lower temperatures (It gets really bad beyond 500 celsius) and makes repairing even more of a bitch and expensive than ever before. Doesnt offer much  more protection than stainless steal, especially for that weak glass that Apple has to ask Samsung for, but make it weaker. Your mom and pop shops definitley cant help you without voiding your warranty with a aluminum frame in most cases (same for s24 eventually), but even worse, no legit repairs without Apple's word.","Its going good, i have no overheating or speaker rattling issues.
I get 10 Hours SOT but i find that Always-on display drains the battery a lot faster so i programmed the action button to turn it on and off quickly.
I have 79% right now.
The 15 Pro also gives me better cell service and signal, which my 13 Pro had problems with.
Overall i'd rate this phone 10/10"," I usually set my charge limit to 80% during working days since I commute by car and keep my phone plugged in. The two apps that significantly drain my phone's battery are Instagram and TikTok. Additionally, I have dual SIM cards activated, with one being an e-SIM, but it doesn't have great reception.","Official quoted statement:

>  We have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected. The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity.
>  
>  We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update. Another issue involves some recent updates to third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system. We‚Äôre working with these app developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out.

The article further states that Apple has said the titanium chassis is not the cause of this issue, nor will the temperatures people are experiencing result in any safety issues or cause long-term damage to the device",I don‚Äôt really have the heating issue but the battery def drains like crazy on the 15 pro max. I hope they find a fix for that,"Nice, 15 Pro Max here with no overheating issues but kind of weird battery, not really sure what to expect since I came from a 12 mini but getting to the end of the day with around 20% is kinda meh.

They also said this fix won't have a performance impact: https://twitter.com/rsgnl/status/1708164855679668715

So most likely something like a scheduling issue with iOS 17","I haven‚Äôt had any heat issues, but the battery on my 15 PM is trash. I have to charge it halfway through the day","My 15 pro gets abnormally hot when charging, I‚Äôve had a for a few days and I‚Äôm still experiencing the same issue.

I‚Äôm assuming software updates will fix this. The last 10 days, I‚Äôve had Safari on-screen for ~5 hours, responsible for 22% of the battery drain. The next 3 apps have ~24 hours on screen, with ~30% battery drain. Something‚Äôs up for sure.",I'll be curious to see the benchmarks before and after.,I do hope they address this. When I picked my 15 Pro Max up from the charging pad this morning it was too hot to hold.,can we get a watchOS update too Apple? ü•π,"I never thought it was the titanium chassis, that‚Äôs something Ming Chi Kuo used as an excuse. My 15 Pro Max barely gets warm even when it‚Äôs charging, more than obvious this was software related due to iOS or 3rd party app issues",Yeah this has to be a software issue imo.,"Guess I'm lucky. Don't have any overheating issues, even with processor intensive apps for video/image/sound editing. And with really good battery life too.","I don‚Äôt have an issue with overheating, but I did lose all of my health data from the last 4 years.  I‚Äôve called Apple several times and none of the troubleshooting steps have worked.  Today they told me it‚Äôs a known issue and they‚Äôre working on it but it‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôll be able to get it back.

If we could pick, I‚Äôd rather my phone get hot.","15 Plus user here, for the first day it indeed got very hot, but didn't experience that again and it's been 4 days since I've got the phone. Battery life is amazing as well. Hope it will get fixed for people who experience issues.",2 years old 13PM (87% Battery health) was much better for me battery wise than my new 15PM.,I got my 15PM yesterday. It was warm for like an hour setting up from iCloud but it‚Äôs been perfect ever since. I‚Äôm sure Apple wouldn‚Äôt rush through the testing process since they‚Äôve been doing this for well close to 20 years.,"Not sure what‚Äôs going on with mine, but on a car Qi magnetic charger it gets really warm and eventually pauses charging due to heat.",I was just playing some Apple Music straight from the speakers for about 30 minutes. I picked up the phone and it‚Äôs very warm. What gives? The screen wasn‚Äôt even on.,"Cool, IOS 17 sure seems to have a lot of problems. My iphone 11 kept forcing hard reboots on ios 17, almost once a day. And then when I got my 15 pro max, no issues for the first few days, and then randomly youtube went all black, and I got a hard reboot forced on me. Also the camera app froze yesterday, but I could just restart the camera app.

the ability to beam a damn satellite for emergency situations

OLED on the non-pro model now

despite non-pro model getting last year's pro SoC, it's still equal to or faster than most of the android SoC's, so it doesn't really matter in nearly every scenario for most people

lighter from use of titanium

better repairability via removable back glass

brighter peak brightness hitting 2000 nits in direct sunlight.  that's a massive brightness by the way.  the average cheap computer monitor is 200 nits, for reference

improved camera, and up to 5x telephoto for crazy 120mm equivalent shots on the pro max model

ability to write proraw video straight to external storage will make this an amateur videographer's gateway device, and should be able to do plenty for starting out, especially since iPhone has always excelled at video recording almost without competition 

ability to change focus after a shot is really epic

price stayed the same.  the pro max looks like it went up $100, but they really just got rid of the 128gb option and shifted it up, so the base 256gb model is the same price as the last gen one was for 256gb, so technically the same, but I can see the argument in both directions, but all things considered, it's the flagship and I think they can get away with it

Their business model has changed drastically.

Apple was - hardware company with an operating system

Then Apple focused on services, their services revenue is now higher than their iPhone revenue was 10-15 years ago.

Then Apple have become an ecosystem company, most people who say Apple don‚Äôt innovate probably don‚Äôt have Apple products.

Apple products seamlessly connect with one another, they‚Äôre incredibly easy to have all of them work cohesively with no hiccups.

So what people are actually saying is ‚ÄòApples hardware has not innovated‚Äô and by that they mean the form factor hasn‚Äôt changed much in 10 years.

Well neither have other phone manufacturers, and honestly that‚Äôs fine.

There will be a breakthrough change in hardware in the next 10 years and we won‚Äôt be saying it.

When they launched the same happened as with the PC's between the 80s and 2k. Every new gen had new features and so much more performance, that your device was obsolete by the time you walked past the cashier and left the store.

Now the CPU's reached the limit we had with x86 (PCs) for a long time - small, increment improvements. Same goes with components. At first there was a new finger print scanner. That got improved for quality and it moved behind the display in some cases.

For now we reached a point where we can't improve much anymore, as the space is limited in the phones and we already have really optimized components. There might me small increments to it, but nothing that makes you want the new phone.

And I honestly doubt, we will see  a ""must have"" hardware feature in the foreseeable future.

The only thing they can really improve on is software / AI, but I'm not sure, what you could do with it, to create a function you really crave for. You want, you need.

Ordered pro max titanium 512, said it would be the 22nd.

Paid with 3 Apple gift cards for extra credit card points, and paid through the active junky shopping portal for an extra 4% cash back.

I didn't do a trade-in, I didn't do any accessories.

I pre-ordered my accessories after the keynote, so when it came time to order, nothing would be slowing things down.

It's a shit show every year, especially if you order the most popular models.","I'm in the US. It took me 20 minutes to get in this year - a new record for me. I don't know if that's demand or I was just lucky other years. Regardless I got the phone I wanted (512GB Max) and even a late AM pickup time.

That said, the process is worse than Ticketmaster for such a supposedly customer-centric company. I understand if its servers can't let everyone in the world in simultaneously but why not

1. have country specific launches at local times.
2. if you are going to have a ""waiting room,"" tell customers they are in a ""waiting room"" so they don't refresh and lose their place,

or 3) if it's not a waiting room make a waiting room the wait Ticketmaster does it so at least you know where you are in line and how fast the line is moving.

And finally 4) if you pre-configure a phone ahead of the pre-sale why not have the option for that to become an order automatically  when the pre-sale starts so those people don't have to log in and clog the server.

Of course my guess Apple would never do any of this because it enjoys this chaos because it generates a  story for cable news: ""Apple servers slammed today for new iPhone pre-sale ordering....""

Also the way they butchered the camera quality and battery life after software updates is daylight robbery.",i keep hearing Australians / Canadians saying iPhone is expensive af but lo and behold,Which memory size also did you count countries national prices for that iphone.,All for a recycled product?,It will change soon as India is going to manufacture iphones in the country itself,"Still, not using my 1.69% on that shit.",Taiwan is definitely too high on the list.,"Does this account for variations in iPhone prices in all of these countries? Does it use the published price from Apple‚Äô website? If so, does it account for FOREX?","OFC Cuba is not here... we earn $300 USD a Year, how would our index be?","And those are only the reported salaries for the country at the top. Can‚Äôt even mention those who make so little like less than $2 a day. I went back recently and you could have 3 meals from street food and even sit in restaurants with the $2. Hotel was super cheap even at the ‚Äúnicest‚Äù one of the capital and was like around 50 bucks. Great place for visit, but not to live (source me and my family from there lol). It‚Äôs quite sad.","I'd really like to see this alongside iphone market share for each country.

Also - is this based on the US price of $799, or the local price which is often MUCH higher?",Cuba: approx. 5 years if you work full time in a government lower tier position,"Cool, US get cheap phones. Next do life-saving surgeries! :D",I didn‚Äôt realize Pakistan‚Äôs average salary was so much lower than indias. Has is that possible? Aren‚Äôt they roughly dealing with the same factors?,Venezuela would probably be off the chart,"I'm from Italy and I can say, even though this chart seems accurate, These iphones are getting way too expensive and not really worth the price the Apple asks. The competition has become really good, Especially the brands like Xiaomi in here.",Inaccurate. Argentina should be double or more...,median or mean salary? important distinction,Spain nearly 5% ? If most common salary is 1100-1300.. how can be 5% ? Xd,I‚Äôm surprised there‚Äôs 2 nations cheaper than the US. Either they have amazing average salary or somehow a imported US product is cheaper there which is highly unlikely.,Money better spent elsewhere tbh.,"According to what I have found, for Poland the number should be about 7,3%.

I used to make comments like ""yeah, to get a ps4 i need to work for five years without eating or expending anything""",Luckily the phones sold in Asia are better and cheaper than iPhones so they don't have to worry,"Umm, sir, can I get 65.94% of my yearly salary in advance? I need it so bad.",Living in third world country sucks man.,"Does this include the import duties and other additional costs in each country, or only MSRP in USD (Apple‚Äôs currency) converted into local currency?


What ‚Äúaverage annual salary‚Äù is used for each country and how were those determined or sourced?","Kad sam bio u Tunisu pre par godina bukvalno je svako imao iphone, sad ne znam da li imaju preko operatera na kredit ili kako vec, ali meni je bilo bas cudno da ni jednu osobu nisam sreo a da nije koristio iphone.",Same stats for buying a property in comparison would be interesting,So this is basically nominal GDP per capita?,"This is just an iPhone 15 **regular**, not even the Pro Max Plus whatever??",do the ppl who done this research has any idea about salaries in Morocco,"""Based on yearly median salary""


So glad that half the country can spend 1% of their income on an iPhone while 38 million people can't even get out of poverty and substantially more than that can't get a living wage.","I love how Redditors get their panties in a bunch when the discussion of the price of the newest iPhone is, as if the newest versions of non-iPhones aren‚Äôt also $1,000+.

Federal Civil service minimum wage is still ‚Ç¶30,000.00 (~$30) monthly.",Very interesting chart but I don't like the fact that it's not specified what iPhone 15. It's a price range of a few hundred $$ so the chart has nearly no meaning to me,"Totally wrong for a couple countries. When I live in Serbia, for example, my neighbor is a doctor at the hospital in town and he makes less than 1000 euros a month. Average salary is about 450 euros a month. 

An iPhone (newest model) is about 2000 euro on the cheap end (if you know someone) and more like 3000 euro. 

So it‚Äôs more like half a years salary for the average Serb.",Income before or after tax? iPhone 15 what?,"I'm pretty sur you didn't took the price of the iPhone in each of these countries and only convert the USA price, right ?

Cause it's completely wrong to do that.",Apparently they think Americans make on average 80k a year before tax and about 60k after tax. No shot that‚Äôs even close to right. The actual net income of the average American is closer to 32k.  Which would be closer to 3.12% of an Americans average yearly salary,Poland is wrong. It's \~1.5 of an average monthly salary so \~12% of yearly.,"Hmm. Is this using the US dollar price, or the local price. Because I see that the phone is shown as relatively more expensive in Japan than in the UK, but 

UK Price ¬£999    
Japanese Price 159,800 yen

159,800 yen is about ¬£869

So the Japanese price is actually a lot cheaper than the UK price. And I suspect the Japanese average salary is equivalent or better than the UK average salary. 

So I suspect that this graph is taking the USA price and applying it globally, rather than the local price for each country","HOW?! Brazil 27%???

Simple math:

 Cheaper iPhone15, Apple MSRP R$7299.

Brazil's minimum wage R$1221. (35% of population)

SIX MONTH without food.","The fact that they deliberately raise the price to give it 'premium' appeal. Just like red bull does, both are terrible.","RIP.
